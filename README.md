# Problem statement
Predicting the review stars from 1-5 star ratings based on the review given by the user.

Machine Learning project aims

*  learn text vectorization (IF-IDF)
* big data handling & preprocess the data
*  merging two big datasets
*  treat problem as rgression and classification, observe it
* Apply and compare tradition AI models with Deep Learning Nueral Network

Tools and Libraries used
* sklearn
* TensorFlow
