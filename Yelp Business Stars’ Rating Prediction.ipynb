I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \\n\\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout &amp; style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \\n\\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!\"</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>WTqjgwHlXbSFevF32_DJVw</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>b\"I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!

Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn\\'t stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won\\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don\\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\\'t do you job properly.'</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["              business_id  stars  \\\n","0  ujmEBvifdJM6h6RLv4wQIg  1.0     \n","1  NZnhc2sEQy3RmzKTZnqtwQ  5.0     \n","2  WTqjgwHlXbSFevF32_DJVw  5.0     \n","3  ikCg8xy5JIg_NGPx-MSIDA  5.0     \n","4  b1b1eb3uo-w561D0ZfCEiQ  1.0     \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             text  \n","0  b'Total bill for this horrible service?

I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \\n\\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \\n\\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.

Dr. J. Phillipp is a great dentist, very friendly and professional.  The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n","3  b\"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf.

Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn\\'t stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won\\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don\\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\\'t do you job properly.'

After browsing the menu and a brief discussion with our waiter we ordered seafood noodles and a 3 item mix meat plate BBQ pork chicken and ducknnThe food came soon thereafter and it was hot and delicious  There was large portions and lots of seafood in the seafood noodles and the mix meat plate came with good cuts of meat and the correct saucesnnAfter the meal we received fortune cookies for dessertnnnFoodnThe food was good quality  Ingredients tasted fresh and dishes tasted well made  Food is above average but nothing stood out even though I was quite hungrynnPricenPrice is high in comparative to other Chinese cuisine and comparable to large western restaurant chainsnnServicenThe service is average to slightly below average  A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiterwaitresses are overworked impatient unattentive  Emerald Chinese is no exception  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient  All our services needs were met but the staff was rushed and grumpynnDecornEmerald has tasteful decorations comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths  There is sufficient room to navigate between tablesnnnOverall we had a good meal with large portions received average service and paid slightly more than we had hoped for our mealnn31  50Weve always been there on a Sunday so we were hoping that Saturday dim sum would be less busy No such luck We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed I could understand if it was empty and the carts werent circulating but every table was full It took a while to get drinks and other items napkins The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits but they were acceptableNo automatic doors not baby friendly I frequent this Chinese restaurant before and post partum Dim sum is ok dishes at dinner time are huge service is great BUT there are no automatic doors How am in supposed to push my stroller insideHorrible servicenI went there tonight with my boyfriend because hes passed by the place a couple of times and we wanted to try it out We orders bok choy chicken fried rice and some lemon chicken When we got our food the chicken was hard and looked old like it had been refried So i complained to the server he didnt even acknowledge my complaint and just left i told another server and he told me that  this is how they make it and left without even offering to provide a new one Finally a women server offered to get a new one and even agreed with us that it was old But it took about 20 minutes and all we had was the rice and bok choy By the time they brought it out we just werent hungry anymore considering we did not want to eat the chicken by itself and our rice was already cold Only exception is the sweet older lady who served us the rest of servers were rude One server even went to the table beside us to check the bill to see how much tip a couple had gave after they left We heard him mention tip as he looked at the bill and threw it back down angry Disgusting will not returnOne of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patronsnnMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch 900 AM  1100 AM on weekends The food is great the place is clean and there is ample parking around the restaurant From within the restaurant you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do notnnThe ideal time to come on weekends is between 1000 AM and 1100 AM Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet Come after 11 AM expect to fall in line nnThe staff is efficient but do not expect a lengthy conversation For a place like this this is not a put down Its what I expectnnThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what youd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts The turnaround is pretty quick a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables so very seldom is the food going around for too long My personal favorites are the sweet pork  served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry chicken feet shrimp  served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap pork and century egg congee and the douhua silken tofu with syrup My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodlesnnThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you then this place is difficult to beatIve been a frequent at this place for years enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family And I have to say this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunchnnFirst of all the place is HUGE My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings events gatherings and we usually get a good experience On some days when you come at a busy time its not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated but maybe this has changednnFOOD I honestly think its great here though it is a bit expensive for what it offers I prefer the lunch dim sum letting them wheel carts as you take your pick Its nice because Im definitely not a decisive person so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things  lol the siu mai dumplings theyre all very good I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here theyre cooked well and Ive never had any rubbery or overcooked meatnnSERVICE is all pretty good too imo a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so its not too hard for us Theyre usually fast too bringing drinkssaucesplates when we ask right away nnnnI would definitely recommend this place to people The reason its a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them However I love coming back at lunch I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience Actually I go almost every week and Ive not noticed any drop in quality so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for nowWe chose this restaurant for our Chinese New Year dinner The menu has a wide variety of dishes The service was par We order the pre fix menu and some side dishes  The waiter was at first not acoomendating but after a discussion with my dad they agreed on what we asked for The food was mediocre to good Most dishes were hot and tasty besides a few that were a bit salty Overall the experience was goodI went at 230 on a Monday It was dimsum nnI hated every second I was there the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and I dont understand why nnwe got gar how  a spinach dumpling nnAfter that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till I finally I gave up nnwe went to pay and it was 14 which is soooo high for what we got  nnIll never ever go back nn food was good thoughMy family and I were at Emerald yesterday during the busiest point of dim sum traffic All I can say is it is total mayhem There werent any lines during the time we were there but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly I cant really blame them I get it When you have a good thing capitalize on it Though this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I dont particularly find enjoyablennThere is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good When it comes to dim sum they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be Again a symptom of the style of restaurant nnService was perfunctory at best Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it in as few words as possiblennOverall 3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be But the food is actually not badBecause we are in Mississauga I think this place is pretty good compare to other dim sum places around the area Me and my family used to come here a lot but nowadays we all so busy that we come here lessnnThe dim sums here arent as fancy as the one in Mississauga China Town but I dont mind the look I just mind about the tastennTips only a few dim sum need to order Most of them are pushed outWhenever I go here on the weekend this place is super busy  Expect to wait about 30 minutes for a table  This place is also mutliethnic  You will see people of all different races coming here  This place is one of the chinese dim sum restaurants that white people like to come to  nnThe food is decent but it is pricey  You can find much cheaper dim sum places elsewhere but if you dont speak chinese you will be more comfortable coming here nnSometimes depending on what time you come here there will be barely any food coming around nnDerekCame on a weekday morning with bf to avoid the weekend crowds and we definitely enjoyed our experience herennFood 55nOrdered a bunch our staples lotus leaf wrapped sausage and sticky rice preserved egg congee egg yolk bun And they were all pretty bombnEmployees were walking around with carts full of dim sums Super Cantonese stylenSome items in the cart are off the menunnService 55nSuper friendly and funny staffsWilling to explain everything despite the language barriernnEnvironment 35nBit outdatednLobby and washroom are particularly sketchynnOverall 45 will returnnAnd we were told on weekends there are a more variety of dim sumsDespite the poor service here my family comes here for special occasions because the quality of their dishes is pretty decent There is a wide variety of dishes and you can also order a 10course meal if youd like The dim sum menu is also very selectivennBut as mentioned the service is terrible Youll expect to wait 2030 mins for your food especially if you come with a large group I know you cant expect good service from an asian restaurant but Im used to the quick eat in and out type of meal and its definitely subpar service here The waiters are also not very friendly and give you attitude when you ask when your food is comingnnI only give this restaurant 2 stars because the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the qualityselection of food is goodThe dimsum here is actually alright Food was good relative to its price Servers were nice despite language barriers Nicely lit and seemingly tidyclean environment with beautiful decor Wasnt the best dimsum Ive tasted but it was goodThis is one of the few bigger chinese restaurants in mississauga They have solid good food Although in recent visits the service has been lacking nMy family and I always come here for birthdays holiday and recently Chinese New Year dinner nnIn those few times the service of our food has taken a very long time The food does not arrive until 2030 minutes after ordering Not only that but they did not provide the starter soup nnWhen we question the servers about the wait time we received some lip It was only when the managers came to serve us the service was a bit better nnEmerald overall is a great restaurant but next time we might take our family business elsewhereWe have been going here to eat for years whether it is a celebration or just a regular night out for dinnernI always continue to go here yes the service isnt that great but I wont complain about the service the place is always extremely busy and I think that speaks for itselffood never disappoints dim sum delivery fresh authentic Chinese foodGood dim sum not too expensive out in Mississauga but worth the trip nnOur family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger varietynnI think its consistently good not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasnt a wait because that meant the food usually sat around Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants nnIm giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto its usually the place I think of first But really maybe it should be 35nnNot sure about the service or nondim sum menu so this review is just for dim sumnnI like anything with bbq pork especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle and baked bbq pork buns I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce wrapped sticky rice Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessertnnNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so Im describing the dishes sorry but if youve been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out Next time I go Ill try to update the namesTraditional and authentic Dim Sum I couldnt believe I walked in a 3pm on a weekday and there were carts full of dim sum Lots to choose from and new dumplings I never tried Mighty impressed by taste but when the bill came I was shocked 30 for 5 items Ah well ya live once Im going backPoor service overpriced food  Make sure to check your dim sum bill  They tried cheating me and making things more expensive  Very dishonest business and would not go backThis is the second time Ive ever been here and I was quickly reminded why I didnt come back after the first time I came on a weekend after the lunch rush so the restaurant wasnt busy at all Most of the dim sum I ordered I noticed was just pulled from a sitting cart so it needed to be warmed up  I believe they had to microwave it The food is normal You can get the same taste and quality type food at other dim sum restaurants and pay literally half the price Some dim sum items are 6 a plate which I dont think is justifiable at all when I can get the same dish and portion size elsewhere for half the cost I almost fell off my chair when my 70 bill for 2 people arrived at the table I wont be returning here and wouldnt recommend my friends to go here Its way overpricedFood is really good the place is super busy during the weekend I love it Remembers me China nnBut I find the price too high for what it is I still highly recommend this placeWe saw that the rating was not that high but decided to stop by anyways A lot of Chinese restaurants with great food but poor service often suffer on yelp ratings but the food here was not good enough to balance out the bad servicennWe got there at around noon on a weekday and it was pretty full It took a few minutes for someone to seat us We ordered some dishes from the carts but realized we had no utensils It took about ten minutes for us to wave someone over to bring us some Although the guy who seated us asked us what tea we wanted he never brought it by and it took another ten or so minutes for us to get someones attentionnnWe got beef changfen shrimp dumplings spinach moon dumplings curry octopus and meatballs The skin on the dumplings and changfen was soft but too thick for the amount of filling inside The meatballs were flavorful but not very tender Only the octopus had both flavor and textureMy family15 ppl and I came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday We got there and the reservation was under my uncles name and they already choosed and paid for the dishes they selected for each table  The waitress was badgering us appetizerssoups but we didnt know that it was extra most of it didnt taste really good especially the tripeliver which made me gagThe basic Chinese food like the sizzling beef mushrooms chow mein was really good though However the lack of customer service pissed me off My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didnt even have the manager literally got up in my uncles face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that theyre going to call the police That is not how you treat a customer  We are never going back because of how we were treated Overall the food gets a 35 and customer service gets 25 I hope they dont treat other customers like thatI would say Emeralds has worsen over a period of few months honestly the service here was never the greatest but now it has gotten to the point where the employees barely know any english nnAlso they served us with dumplings that have gone bad and were very sour in taste  Meh I wouldnt really care however they charged us for it So I have to pay to eat dumplings that may prove to be a health concern  nnAt least the washrooms were clean PThe dim sum here is really good  There was a huge lineup on Sunday  There was alot of variety  More than many other dim sum restaurants  if you are close to the airport this will be a great place to go for dim sum in Mississauga  Its only about 20min from the Toronto airport  There is not alot of push carts left in the Toronto area  Their prices are reasonable  Four people can be really full on 50 for lunch  nnI used to live in Mississauga and this was one of the better restaurants in the area  If its a weekend youll have to wait at least half an hour at lunch  If you only have 2 people you might get a table right away  They have a few 2 people table that no one uses  Most people come here in groups of 4 or moreIve been here a quite a few times over the last two or three years and something has definitely changed The quality of the food has gone down hill and the prices are ridiculous nnToday I went with my husband for lunch and we were disappointed The food was cold and on four occasions after we ordered the dim sum the woman said okay let me warm it up for you and proceeded to the back to microwave it What the heck Why are they pushing around cold dishesnnWhen we asked for shrimp rice rolls the waiter put in the order to the kitchen  we thought great at least it will be fresh Well when they came out we wanted to send it back The roll was gummy and falling apart Not pleasant at all nn40 for seven dishes four of them microwaved one of them barely edible  just not a good meal Should have gone to Manchu WokI usually come here when nothing else is open especially during holidays It takes forever to get your food especially take out I usally get there seafood and beef fried rice Nothing special Service isnt that great either but its the only place open during xmas and new years lolI usually really like the dim sum here but my lunch here yesterday was a real letdown We came right before 2pm so maybe the timing something to do with it but Im told their dim sum is on till 4pmnnThe har gow was the worst Ive ever had and I rarely get to say that about har gow The shrimp was tiny rubbery and it tasted off I was just glad we didnt get sick off it It tasted completely different from how they used to do it here so Im not sure if they used a bad batch but if so it shouldnt have been served in the first place Another staple the shiu mai was also pretty bad It was tasty usually but it was tiny and Im not sure if it had any fish egg topping either If it did it wasnt noticeable The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it We also ordered some fried pork  veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess Stuff like this should be basic The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce The xiao long bao was also decentnnOverall it seems like theyre skimping on everything that costs money now Despite that prices are higher than other dim sum spots Thats not a good combination I hope the owner recognizes this soon because itd be a shame for one of the few good dim sum spots in the city to keep on this pathFood was awesome but the service was horrible I felt like I had to hunt someone down to order items Might try one more time due to the food being deliciousThis is THE place for Dim Sum in Mississauga Dont despair if you see a huge line up at the door on weekends things move quickly There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering systemso just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food The food is cooked in steamer baskets and walked around the restaurant on carts Someone at your table has to take the key ordering position so as to flag down the cart and get the food on the table The food runs out quickly so dont wait for it to come around again it may be a while or never They do a great job with the staple DS fare Har gow shrimp dumplings Shui Mai pork and sticky rice My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce Try the Chinese greens dumpling soup and pork sesame seed buns The spring rolls  with meat filling are awesome as wellnThe best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays Anytime after 200 pm is pointless as they will be out of most food itemsthis place is the best place to get dim sum  the food is delicious and the staff is always welcoming and attentive to our needs the only thing im not crazy about it the washrooms and anyone who knows me knows I like to see how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of their bathroomsthe service in this place is poooor hands down as is the case with most chinese restaurants  but the food is good and well priced if u can handle lack of service but good food this place is for you went there for dinner and it wasnt that busy but the service was but food was good and well sized portionsThis is your standard dim sum however its a bit more expensive than other dim sum locations in the area Overall a good experience and would recommend to try out Had their 11 course menu and the food was all very tasty and cooked well There is a great bubble tea store next door tooI used to work in Oakville if coworkers and I wanted dim sum this is the only place thats reasonably close AND offers decent food nnMy Dim Sum SSQSW nnServe Style  push cart I would have preferred ordering from a menu but coworkers who arent dim sum regulars like the pushcart style so they can peek before ordering nnSelection  good aplenty on seafood dishes steamed shrimp dumpling steamed shrimp with chives dumpling fried shrimp dumpling fried shrimp with chives dumpling  you get the gist They have all the usual suspects for dim sum nnQuality  okay Because its always busy weve not had unfresh food nnService  so so I think they try to be efficient if not warm and attentive The servers are always in such a rush whos got time to smile at or chat with you If you want something just be assertive and flag someone down in a polite way nnWait Time  avoid 1145  1245 peak lunch time Otherwise finding a parking and getting a table will taste your patienceIm writing this update based on the lunch I had here today nnIm so annoyed that the service is so incredibly rude I can understand that they might be busy and need to move fast Sometimes they respond to me but they look the other way Im okay with that too nnBut today we went and I would ask people for tea and cutlery and things and they would put a grump face and storm away only to come back with the minimal amount of things nnI mean we asked for hot sauce and he just  violently squeezed hot sauce in everyones bowls I was shocked and then so I asked for more bowls And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl What about everyone elsennSome other servers are quite nice If you need anything try to flag down the guy in the suittie or the ladies in the black blazers Anyone else will just throw things at you figurativelynnThey also again tried to put stuff on our table and I had to tell them to take it back When she was confused what i wanted I got yelled at nnI think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better It would be the managers serving you not the others nnNonetheless the place is always packed full of the local asian folk which is a good thing I can understand why its cheap and the food is quite decent they can cook the short ribs a bit more  This time with 5 people we paid 11 a person nnIf it wasnt for the only dim sum place in proximity and my coworkers loving it so much I wouldnt come back nI really dont need to be treated like a 2nd class citizenYears ago they were great  Not much of a fan of their food anymore  I dont go for dim sum but rather actual dinners  Havent been impressed with their cost as it seems to be rising despite being busier than I can ever rememberWe ordered the duck It looked and tasted like fried plastic I had a watery bowel movement 30 min after leaving the restaurant My stomach did not like it either I have decided I will only eat Mandarin restaurant Chinese food from now on I do not think I can handle authentic Chinese food because it is disgusting and poor quality meat Lots of tiny bones in the meat by the way I felt like I was eating scraps fed to dogs  and I paid to experience thisnnNoodles I did not tryThis was terrible I was forced to go there on a team event at work and it was quite awful A bunch of people walking around in carts and you holler at them better have someone who speaks Cantonese with you so they can understand if you want something on the cart they are tagging along I tried some of those foods that the workmates had called up on the table as we were haring the bills and everything from the rice to the chicken to every single thing was terrible Maybe my palette is not open minded enough but the whole design where you call on the waitresses with the carts which I guess is Dim Sum is not my thingI wouldnt come back When they took us here I was hoping it was an average North American Chinese restaurant or at least if they had some common North American Chinese dishes Id be fineit was too traditional in my opinioneither that or the people I went with ordered the food that is so Either way I left hungry and didnt like it at allCame at 11ish AM on a Saturday and didnt really have to wait for a tablennStandard dimsum service Really nothing much else to say Environment is quite nice though for a dimsum place Also its cartserviceMy family has been going here off and of for probably close to 10 years  Im almost certain it has changed owners during that time  Anyhow we generally try not to come here as its not a great Chinese restaurant but its one of the very few Chinese restaurants that can hold a large group  nnWe arrived with a table of 10 and we had reservations  After being confused why we were told we had a 40 minute when we had reservations we finally sat down after talking to the head hostess for 20 minutes  This didnt start off our meal on the right footnnWe choose a smaller banquet meal for 8 and supplemented with a few other dishes since we didnt like the really big banquet dinners  The typical complimentary soup came out and the service was clearly not interested in service  The soup spilled all over the place when it was taken from the serving bowl to the smaller bowls  This behaviour continued throughout the meal  Most dishes were just thrown onto the table while the waiter often just pushed people aside to get to the centre of the table  The only thing that saved the meal were the dishesnnThough they werent outstanding or great all the dishes were fairly well executed  Nothing was greasy oily underseasoned overseasoned or burnt  Steamed fish was fresh and light  Chicken was cooked perfectly and moist  Vegetables were nicely flavoured and still crispy  The lobster could be better it was on the scrawny side and it was hard to find any meat in there  All in all  nothing horrible among the 10 dishes we ordered  nnIn comparison to the east end this restaurant is probably just average but since were in Mississauga it stands to be one of the better ones  Its too bad we dont have a great Mississauga Chinese restaurantVery busy on weekends but definitely more food and cart options then during the weekdays when you wont catch yourself in line Good food the only Dim Sum in Mississauga with Sweet and Sour Pork Feet w Eggs sounds gross but its believed to be very nutrional as the Vinegar in the soup helps purify the bloodUnfortunately there is not many choices for dimsum in mississauga This is our togo place for dimsum We dont go samwoo because we feel like Emerald has more selection than samwoo Food is average some dishes are decent however some are not fresh nnDont ever expect a good service from here They suck at services The waiters waitress sometimes give you an attitude It really depends on their moods to give you a good servicewont be back againnAt most only the coke was good Its the only thing that came at the right temperatureCame here for dimsum on a Sunday with a group of 20  Its just your typical dimsum restaurant and it definitely hit the spot for me  We got around 10 different dishes and everything tasted greatThis is probably the most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Mississauga Largely because of all the 1 star reviews for poor service Despite this the place constantly has line ups for their dim sum so they must be doing something right Ive honestly never had a bad dim sum dish here Har gow beef balls sticky rice lotus leaf rice shiu mai tofu with crab meat congee pig feet etc Everything is great The service is plain spoken and frantic but thats dim sum for you Its certainly not worse than other similar restaurantsWe just walked out of this restaurant and I would give this place zero stars if I could It started out badly from the beginning when a member of my party asked for a fork and the server told them they couldnt have one until after we place an order  which is complete nonsense After the food was ordered we requested hot sauce The servers did not even want to take the time to let us finish our words before they walked away begrudgingly to get the wrong sauce Next the food came it was all lukewarm and mediocre at best Heavily lacking spices and any semblance of flavour Lastly to add insult to injury our bill arrived We watched as all the other tables around us enjoyed their oranges and fortune cookies as their bills arrived that for some reason we were not treated to I guess we didnt qualify for themnnThis is my first review and I felt so compelled by the horrible food and even worst service that i felt it was my duty to warm others Go elsewhere Its one thing to have bad service and good food or vice versa but not both sadly nnWe will not be returningWe used to go here quite a bit for dim sum but lately weve been going elsewhere  Today we found ourselves there for a last minute family dim sum brunch  I was reminded of why we dont really go there anymorenn1  The layout Depending on where you sit you may get hot dim sum fresh off the carts or you may get that cart that has onesies of everything left overwhich implies you may have to wait quite awhile for that one item youve been jonesing for  You could order it too but that can take some time  nn2  The quality  Sometimes its good sometimes its meh  Its rarely excellent nn3  The wait  OMGoodness  On a Sunday morning at noon you can expect a hefty wait especially if youre in a group larger than 4  I dont even attempt Saturday morning  Id have to assume that the rush dies down after 2 pm but dont quote me on thatnnId say its a good place to go if youre a dim sum newb and you like to see the items before you order them  But otherwise there are better options out thereI LOVE dim sum and this place does it RIGHT The dishes are consistently good The only problem might be in dealing with the servers that dont speak English If you look asian and cant speak Cantonese or Mandarin they look at you like you are from another planet But you come for the food and that is the most important This is old school Chinese food at its bestnnIts always busy so if you like a quiet intimate setting then this is not for youBad reception from the hostess We ordered items but were later told some of them are not available We switched but when the bill came it still included the switched items The waiter had to go validatennFood was soso better for post bar consumption nnWashrooms had not been taken care of for at least several hours paper everywhereThis place is a hidden gem in Mississauga  It might look a little rundown on the outside and the foods were absolutely legit and authentic  Dim sum was outstanding my family and I technically had stayed in Toronto for 4 days and we had dim sum over here twice already  Yes it was that good  Presented with a wide variety of dim sum savory and sweet from the steamed buns to baked sago pudding dessert wish I had more room in the stomach  Dinner was not super duper but prices were reasonable and foods were not bad at allHave been there many times for dim sum and was always great First time for dinner and the service was so bad Will not be back nnGlasses were dirty with food stuck on them and fingerprints everywhere Pretty scary nnFelt like it was such a hassle to have us eat there The wait staff constantly reach over you to serve or take away things from the table It was an experience I wont forget anytime soonI have dined a few times for dim sum and dinner  I like their menu as there is traditional Chinese dishes and unique dishesnnThey have set menus for dinner which have a nice variety  The food always taste good but sometimes the service is good and sometimes not so muchnnI would return again as the food keeps me coming backTheir dim sum is a bit pricier compared to other places but their spring rolls have got me hookedThis place has pretty good food iv never had a bad time here Good portions good taste It is a tad pricey tho if i might add I come here all the time so I guess iv gotten used to the pricing They open late almost every night they close at 1 for most nights I think Staff is friendly but most of them dont speak alot of English but theres one who speaks good English tho I just dont like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom looks sketchy Theres fish tanks with crab and other seafoodalive tho And it right along where people sit down and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet thats the only thing I dont likewhy couldnt they put this anywhere else I dont knownBUT overall good place Ill still be coming here alotAs far as DimSum goes these people work hard that is clearly evident Food is never far away if you see something that you like youd better get it because the place is packed and it might not be there the next time the cart comes around The food is good although not the best by most standards Most of the time the food is fried so you can forget about individual flavors Thankfully there is quite an amazing variety of foods and it is fresh I loved the octopus as well as the wonton Chicken feet were available so the wife was impressed We got there late230pmso DimSum was wrapping up and as I said earlier the staff were in the midst of transforming the dining room the staff is on pointThey charge you for tea My boyfriend and I came here for dim sum and when we asked whats this charge on the bill the lady replied for tea How ridiculous never ever been to a dim sum place that charges for cheap tea If youre going to charge for tea make sure you ask if we are going to drink it Bad service and garbage food and ridiculously expensiveI have been to Emerald many times in the past 15 years  nThey used to have pretty good dim sumnnNow that Im old enough to form my own opinion my view of them is somewhat tarnishednn1 the dim sum is often recooked and carted so often that it arrives coldnn2 the carts have some of the most inefficient routes such that it is impossible to get the dishes you want unless you get up and hunt them downnn3 slow service  it took quite a while to get change for the bill  i would have thought they wanted a faster turnaround ratenn4 theyre not exactly cheap for chinese foodnn5 this one really bugged me  last time I went close to end of dim sum and they cracked out the vacuum and started vacuuming right next to my table  Not sure about everyone else but i dont particularly want to eat vacuum dust nor do I enjoy the sights and soundsA great place for hangover lunch The food is good and reasonably priced but can add up very quickly Only a few servers speak English so dont expect a1 servicenVery lively restaurant around lunch time because of dim sum It gets quite loud and rowdy but thats part of the fun nnOverall its a good place to go for cheap dim sum in the Mississauga area that wont disappoint youThe phrase looks can be deceiving certainly applies here Although the decor is nice with bright lights white tablecloths and golden chair covers its ultimate downfall is the food nnThe majority of dim sum items were deep fried Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin These were very thick nnI asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a shrimp biscuit I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground porknnThe staff were awful Apart from yelling at each other from across the room they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice nnOne cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us After asking for the fried noodles on her cart she stamped our card then said she would get us a warm plate She disappeared and we didnt see her again We were about to ask someone about this when another lady came with a plate of noodles They were microwaved nnI think its safe to say Ill never come back here again There are so many other good dim sum places Richmond HillMarkham that are definitely worth the drive Do yourself a favour and dont eat hereFood is average but the service is the worse The waiters are rude or indifferent Service is slow We only go here because there arent many dim sum places in the areaMeh  If the ingredients were a little fresher and the recipes are a little healthier it would be worth a review  nnMSG ME  No please dontMy family are regulars at this place and we went today again during one of their peak periods weekends during lunch It was extremely packed  a pretty long wait time I would assume Luckily there are perks to being regulars at this restaurant less wait time attentive service and the tea surcharge is waived nnI generally go here because of the hustle  bustle atmosphere and because the dim sum is relatively consistent in quality Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted Probably not but I still enjoy it because its still one of the best most popular and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga its always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion  it indicates food is always made fresh for customers If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town this place is it Theres not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh  hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet so it may take away from the experience if youve never tried thisnnIf youve never been to dim sum I think going here would be a good experience Its nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible Some of the dishes I order regularly are XO stir fried rice noodle rolls spare ribs in black bean sauce fried crab claw a bit expensive 5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure fried seaweed rollnnOnly negatives about this place could be long wait times not for people who dislike busyloud environments not for extremely starving people you might have to wait if you cant find something you like right away on a cart specialtylarge dishes are expensive not very wheelchair accessible I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurantplaza isnt that friendly for wheelchairsNothing special esp for toronto Probably one of the poorest dim sum i have had in TO Selection was very poor Service slow And they never came to our side with foodThe dim sum here is great The regular menu not so much I havent had a dim sum item not taste good so I cant make any recommendations Try anything Prices are slightly higher than other places but its deservednnLines can be longThe worst dining experience in my entire life Im not talking about the  foods but the quality of service The dim sum lady was rude we asked three times to not serve food that we didnt want and she still ignored us I spoke to the general manager and she seemed not to care or even at least saying sorryCame here for dinner a few days ago Ordered two dishes from the create your own set dinner menu  the braised beef brisket and tendon bowl and the soft scrambled eggs with seafood Came with house soup xe8x80x81xe7x81xabxe6xb9xaf and dessert xe7xb6xa0xe8xb1x86xe6xb2x99 and orange slicesnnThe braised beef was very good if not a bit oily The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked  not too mushy and not too crunchy The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable I would have expected a root vegetable like carrots or turnips but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquidnnThe eggs were a bit uneven with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked The seafood shrimp and scallop was plentiful and tasty My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily but its kind of to be expected with this dishnnThe house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soupnnService was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves nnPrices were reasonablennOverall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if youre willing to go all the way east to MarkhamScarboroughetcWhenever my friend and I are in the mood for dim sum we come here for their discounted dim sum times 9am11am 2pm4pm The food is always hot fresh and delicious We got pork spare ribs har gow shu mai crab claws beef balls tripe and rice noodle rolls with shrimp Everything was so good and only came to about 15person which is great Im definitely coming back hereBelow average in most waysnService quicknFood not fresh or quality  below average throughout nWonton soup badnLarge roomnDimsum lunch may be slightly better than normal dinner items but i doubt its much betterWent for Dim Sum when it was super packed Their dim sum is terrible Everything had corn and ham in it Ive never had corn and ham in my dim sum until this restaurant The carts with the same food go around and around and around with barely anything new The food is dead cold when you get it because they just circle around multiple times We did not understand how it was so packed when the food was absolutely terrible There was that one lady that kept circling around with the same cart with dim sum nobody wanted that she kept persuading people to get Never get anything from her there is a reason why she keeps going around with the same items not newly replenished ones at thatnWe noticed it was packed with a lot of nonchinese as well not sure if their taste is different from what we are used to from all the other dim sum places weve been to our whole life but their hargow and siumai were the worst Ive ever had in my lifennNot worth the 70 we had to pay Maybe their regular nondim sum menu is better but this experience has turned us off completely from going backThis was the 3rd and last time we come here for dim sum If you are not Chinese they sit you at the back where the carts dont come or the food is cold when it does Waited 15 mins for the first cart Service is poor and with the exception of the chicken feet which were great the rest of the dim sum was mediocre and overpricedYou might need to be rude to eatnnEmerald is a Chinese Restaurant that mainly serves as a banquet hall The chairs are all covered with fake silk seat covers similar to an old banquet hall trying to look newer This place is geared for very large groups nnThe food is decent but the service is geared towards survival of the fittest For Dim Sum it seems that you need to make yourself very visible in order to get served Occupied ladies wheel the carts around with no set predictability or pattern Excuse me can we have some more mustard sauce might be the way you might ask for some sauce Here you might have to say WHERE IS THE SAUCE nnBut if you dont mind being rude because they dont then you might like this place Try sitting closer to the window if you can as the Dim Sum carts seem to frequent that area moreDim sum is great  try to get there between 1100 and 1130 on the weekend Too early and the food is not as fresh and too late means waiting for a table Waiters are great in helping to get the cart you want to stop by you Dim sum us supposed to be a longer family experience but with 3 young kids speed is important and we find it pretty speedy usually nnWe have an Asian friend who insists on going to emerald for dinner when in town With her ordering the food is fantasticOh boy have I ever got news to share herennHave been to this restaurant regularly over a 5 year periodnnThe reason I ate here was for nothing more than the food More on this laternnI noticed that as each year passed the food quality and cleanliness declined I was NOT SURPRISED that 5 months ago the Food Inspectors closed the place down It is filthy In March this year I walked into the mens room to find a floor covered in vomit In most restaurants this would be cleaned up immediatelynnFrom Day 1 I felt the rudeness and aggression from the wait staff In particular an elderly heavy set Waiter who actually scowls when serving or taking ordersnnI once brought some European guests of ours fresh from the Airport for Dinner and they were shockeddisgusted by the rudeness My friend asked the Waiter if he had a problem and if all Canadians are this rude lol The bill was about 70 and we did not give him a penny of tipsnnSo back to the service This year I finally decided that I will never eat in this place ever again nn1 The people are R U D E nn2 The place is dirtynn3 Overpriced nnThose of you who are into Holistic life you can feel the bad energy in the roomnnStay awaynnPS unfortunately YElLP s lowest rating is One star so I give it accordingly In reality it deserves NO STARSLooking over the reviews Emerald has mixed ratings I can understand this If youre looking for a nice sitdown with little interaction with your server youre in the wrong place If youre not very good at saying No lol youre so screwed its not even funnynnEmerald is as has been described to me a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DONT WANT IT nnThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times you just have to be patient The ladies never seen a dude wheeling the carts will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table for which you will be charged so you have to say No multiple times nnI highly HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin I had no idea what 90 of the food was Luckily the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all The food is different so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things Sometimes the food looked like things Id find growing between my toenails but tasted like heaven should taste Leave your inhibitions at homennIt is WELL worth it Im now a huge fan of pork dumplings as seen in other posts and glazed pork buns I can even order for myself now without going all doeeyed in the face of the waiters Im pretty proud of thatnnTLDR Go to Emerald with someone that speaks Mandarin or understand restaurants like this Learn to say No Leave your inhibitions at homeFinally had reason to create a yelp account Came for a Sunday night family dinner but there were 2 wedding receptions booked Competing sound systems with loud music and emcees slow service and generally terrible experience One star for the ok food and sympathy for the wait staffThere was no beef anything Was there a shortage of cowsnnI didnt even see har gow where are the sui mai what do you mean you dont have beef rice roll no meatballs no lava buns NOTHING What kind of place is this This was a Saturday Everything was just carbsThis place is TERRIBLE Dim sum was cold and had very limited option So we ordered a stir fried rice noodle hoping it would be better Little did we know it would take over 30 mins to be served and sooo not worth the time cus it came out lacking in flavour and had a burnt smell nBut nothing was worst then the HORRIBLE service Rude grumpy old waiters walking around ignoring you and giving dirty looks when u try to get their attention or ask for somethingnTo top off our EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT experience there we were given a bill of 7500  For 2 ppl I was charged almost 550 for tea that I didnt even touched Weve ordered way more at other restaurants and our bill usually estimates around 4050nNeedless to say we are NEVER ever returning there just even the thought of it sickens me ughnnIm only giving this place 1star cus I had to if I could I would give them a negative one million starWent here today for lunch with my mom who just moved in to the adjacent condominium complex behind the restaurant nnThis Place Sucked I mean really badnnMy first instinct this was going to be a rough ride was the fact they there was no appetizing aroma either outside or when opening the front doors My second instinct The decor Weird looking yellow chairs ceiling has watermold stains and the TV is showing SlicennWe were taken to our table by a middleaged Asian man who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language as he spoke like Dr Frankensteins monster There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty Then another manager this time a female approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings We said yes but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart that were sitting by the front door The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat  nnNow as for the menu If you eat in as opposed to takeout there is a price hike supposedly because you are getting more food so dont be surprised by the 15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetablesnnThe rice was just plain crap No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice The vegetables were the size of my fist exaggerated but damn folks could you not cut them down to a manageable sizennAll that and Im now 40 in the hole No tip either since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste andor try to shovel it off to someone else Failing that trying to recook it back to some forms of dignitynnShame on whoever cooks the food there seriouslynnThe only plus The cashier was real cuteThe worst service ever I wish there was a 0 star option so I could rate them I came here for dinner with family My father asked for extra chopsticks and the server asked him WHY he needed new chopsticks After explaining that he dropped his and needed new ones a pair of chopsticks taking from a dirty stall finally were given to him from across the table BARE HAND You probably have to know some Chinese when ordering food here as most of the staffs dont speak English I felt like we were begging for food and service attention at this restaurant I dont know how about you but to me it just killed my appetite We ordered deep fried oyster seafood fried rice fried noodle spicy scallop and pecking duck And I have to say these were one of the worst Chinese dishes  I rated Mandarin 3 starsso you know I am not a picky eater here The rice was soggy the spicy scallop was way too salty while the fried noodle was just dry and bland My dinner was ruined I will never come back Avoid at all costHorrible dishes tough beef and very dry fish The portion is tiny and pretty expensive They also charge 25 for a small bowl of rice The service is also exceptionally bad If I could give 0 star thats what it deservesThis is as close as you can get to Hong Kong dim sum here in MississaugannI have been eating here for almost 10 years Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so Im a little behind The place is huge  banquet style seating They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so its very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTAnnThe choice is yours Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu From their Har Gau shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings you can always find something good to eat here When I first arrived at Emerald I didnt quite know what to expect It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy I am telling you all the food is very good herennDim sum carts Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay Noodles and veggies are cheaper Seafood items are higher in cost If you love seafood as much as I do you wont mind paying for itnnMenu I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great If you order the crab it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget When dining here with outoftown family or friends I would always recommend buying the crabnnSo what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays Im listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the fivestar eating experiencennTip 1 Plan wisely  Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse Unless you are absolutely craving their food beware of rushed and rude servicenTip 2 All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishesnTip 3 When you need some service get their attention Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests They are the ones you need to order from so dont be shy and call them over nTip 4 When asking for something no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you When speaking with us needyhungrypolite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders Just say what you need and follow up when they forget If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcomennFor more food reviews and blogging check out my blog at httpsspicychopsticksblogWe came all the way from New York to try this restaurant because it was recommended by some friends  However this is the worst Cantonese restaurant Ive ever been to  We went there for lunch Food was so bad  the beef tasted like it was marinated in some kind of chemicals  I had pretty bad diarrhea after eating at this place  Price was expensive and service was lousy  Will absolutely not go there any moreLast Friday my team from work went to Emerald for dim sum for lunch I drove three of my colleagues over to the restaurant My other colleague took two others nnI decided to go against Google Maps Sometimes I wonder how useful it is to do a uturn instead of turning left at the intersection nnThis plaza gets busy We got there just before noon so we were fine nnWe got a round table There were seven of us We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle nnWe ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there So much for pacing how much we eat nnThe dim sum was delicious Some of my favourites are the followingn Crab claw balls so good especially the meat in the clawn Har gown Sticky rice in fragrant leavesn Rice rolls shrimp and barbeque porknnI had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish nnWe split the bill Each person ended up paying 22 which included the tip I was good with it My boss said that it was expensive This restaurant accepts credit debit and cash nnThe dim sum quality was amazing This restaurant houses a ton of people At one point a tour bus full of tourists came in I would guess that it easily seats 200 people nnId come back here again Its fully licensed which is another reason why I need to come back  nn215Their dim sum and Chinese dishes are better than a lot of other Mississauga ones BUT the 2 stars is because last January 2010  I held my engagement party here and we had worked out a deal because I paid cash up front and on the day of which was one price of 1200 covers 5 tables of catered food  taxes and tips which is not bad nnMy parents went to pay the day of and I was having too much fun taking pictures to go with them The manager the day was such a cheat and liar and told my parents the price did not include the tip so my parents being as trusting as they are gave them an extra 200 on top of it nnI also had given each of our 34 servers a red pocket for lucknnThey also book ours with another huge large party with a microphone so it was really hard to hear anything when speeches or announcements were being made especially for two of my best friends and their parents sitting at the table closest to the other rooms A heads up would have been nicennI didnt find out til a week later when I went to ask my parents if they had change form the 1400 I handed them to pay with SO mad and felt so cheated and my engagement night is now tainted with this memory So since then I have never gone back EVERThis is by far the worst I like how it still have the authenticity of rolling carts with food But the food quality is not good and service is bad I asked for service for 2 times in a row and because of that I was given attitude cause I asked him to get water once and sauce the other time Because of the rolling carts food sometimes comes out coldGreat dim sum Free parking Slow a la cart service but the food is great nnIm more of a quality over quantity kind of gal so if I have to pay a bit more for better tasting food youll find me here The prices are definitely higher than dim sum places in Torontos Chinatown but it tastes so much better Their dishes are also more unique there are a few that Ive only found here and their takes on other kinds are also delicious nnI never have to wait very long to be seated but the a la cart service is a bit slow Helps build up the appetite Id say nnThis is my go to dim sum place Youll always find me here Unfortunately their wifi doesnt work but who needs wifi when you have good foodIve been here twice Once during Chinese New Year They have good dim sumnnThe second time my family went wasnt so good The food was a little cold We found a rubber band in the vegetables The manager crossed off the item on the list after explaining what happenednnThey likely did not wash the veggies since the rubber band was found among them Is that standard in restaurantsnnDespite the manager having crossed the item off the list we still got charged for it We had to talk to a few staff members until we found someone that could speak adequate English the manager was busy elsewherennDim sum was good admittedly The service however is not so good I would avoid the placeI was craving dim sum the day before so my parents took me out for dim sum today We arrived around 1030 am so it wasnt busy at all However it took a while to flag down staff members at the beginning of our visitnnMost of the food that we got were carted out but we also ordered a few items that we didnt see being carted out It is a bit expensive because it came out to 55 including tax and tip for only the three of us Some of my faves today were the scallops shumai noodle roll with shrimp and the curry squidnnOverall it was an average dim sum experience Food was good but service was nonexistent at the beginningDirty cheap ingredients bad service most of the time  How do they stay in businessThe atmosphere in the dining room looks nicer than most Chinese restaurants  Its slightly dated but there are glimmering chandeliers everywhere Persian printed broadloom and nice curtains  nnHaving said that washrooms could be nicer  Again this is another Chinese place where warmhot water in the restrooms is not even an option  Only ice cold water flows out of faucet  And certain stalls are used as storage spaces for cleaning supplies  I really dont like this  It makes me question their cleanlinessnnFoodwise there seems to be quite a large selection for dim sum  Service was also nicer than most places and the staff tried to find out what dish someone in our group wanted but didnt know what it was called  Initially they brought the wrong dish but didnt make a fuss when we said that that wasnt the dish  They also took that extra step by taking out a binder with coloured photos in order to try to identify the particular item  This gets them extra pointsnnOur table ordered so much that we were given 10 discountnnWould get more s if the washrooms matched with the rest of the dining room  Food is alright I guess fancy dining room AND more selection tricks people into thinking that food is better than it actually is but I find it just alrightWhat a joke Service was awful and dim sum was terrible Dont believe the hype for best dim sum in Mississauga Go to Rol San in Toronto Never coming backSo heres the drill HUGE venue I mean banquet hall with the matching drapesstage decorationchairstable cloth kind of banquet hall Full bar no alcohol on tap though The servers are kind of rude and snappy but the service is very fast As for the food IT IS AMAZING The portions are huge absolutely delicious and cooked fresh and the prices are extremely reasonable I ordered the Sautxc3xa9ed jumbo shrimp and grilled vegetables as a healthy option and the shrimp was delicious It was perfectly cooked very light very big very yummy and there was so much of it I struggled to finish My boyfriend ordered the sweet  sour chicken with noodles and they were both great Definitely recommend for a fun night out to much with friends  nnPS They serve you green tea in a little pot when youre first seated and orange slices and fortune cookies after your mealThis is one of the few places Ive seen that still has carts I miss that Given I guess you have to strategize to know whats fresh or not nnThe food was okay Not spectacular but very good A great place to come for a work celebration or work lunch  The clientel is mostly local Chinese folk or people that work near by nnThey are SO aggressive here On many of an occasion they would put plates on our table and say here you like this Were likeno thanks full No you like this And when I say no a second time they take it back one of them was ever grumbling how we didnt want vegetablesnIts like they make a commission here or something nI would suggest know what you want and dont succumb to their ploys nnThey are super busy around here so dont be afraid of putting up your hand and flagging someone down nnim not sure of the price for each dish but for 10 people we paid about 18 PER PERSONTerrible terrible service We were there for dinner Food was good when it came but anticipate waiting for a long time We were there during Chinese New years celebrations and they shouldve anticipated that it would be busy It was disorganized and chaos with servers and kitchen staff All the patrons seemed annoyed with the serviceWent on a Sundayxe2x80x8b morning around 11 and was seated immediatelyxe2x80x8b Im not sure why the ratings for this place is so low but Im a fan Great place far better than any dim sum place back in the states They were missing some of my dim sum favs but everything we had was really great Only downside was that we had a large party and when a cart comes by wed take a couple of plates but all the food would be gone in a minute We would then have to sit a while waiting for the next cart to come over and since we were in the far corner carts were few and far betweenHave been here a few times but will never go back Reason is the excruciatingly long wait for carts and carts that all seem to be missing standard favourites like Har Gow Sticky Rice and Siu Mi Inquiries about when those items might be appearing are simply met with later or soon meanwhile the congee and desert carts have just come around for the seventh time nnMaking a special order for any items will result in about a 30 minute wait not even kidding The food off the carts is more often than not cold which doesnt help nnBasically they have enough Dim Sum carts for a restaurant a quarter of the size Its actually quite comical watching other diners constantly looking around for carts and crying out in unison Where is the food nnIf you want to wait over an hour just to get a few standard Dim Sum dishes that are available quickly anywhere else than go for it Last time I was there I gave up and left after an hour and twenty minutes after having only eaten half of what I came forFood was awful I do like Chinese food but this one was tasteless and smelled terrible I couldnt wait to get my bill and leave They call this thing restaurant I wouldnt go there again even if it is only one place on the earth where I can get food highly disappointedCame on a weekday morning with bf to avoid the weekend crowds and we definitely enjoyed our experience herennFood 55nOrdered a bunch

front where they keep the lobstersnPrice 15  overpriced based on the poor quality of the foodnnnot coming back here anytime soonWeve come to Emerald for both dim sum and dinner before  This review will be for dinnernnOur group of 6 arrived around 7pm on a Friday night  The restaurant was about half full  They seated us at a round table that was a bit lop sided and unsteady because it was a piece of plywood screwed to some fold out table legs  We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged nnWe ordered one of the set menus for 88 which includednn House soupnn 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions  I dont eat crab that often but its probably one of the best Ive tasted  Lots of meat not too much work needed to dig it out  The meat was very fresh and not overdone  nn Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy skinnn Stirfry scallops and shrimps with veggies and jumbo mushroomsnn Fish and deep fry tofunn Stirfry tung choinnIn addition we also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic and half a roast chickennnFood came fast and super hot  Portions were gigantic especially the tofufish and snow pea leaves dishes  Although we did have to order bowls of white rice separately as it was not included in the set menunnDessert was included and it was cold orange slices and a warm sweet tarotapioca soupnnOverall a fantastic meal and way more than enough food for 6 people  We had 2 jumbo containers of leftovers with the bill coming to 140 before tipI had a great time in this restaurant Came here for dinner with a party of 5 The service was very friendly they didnt speak fluent English but you can communicate with them easily The place is just OK cleanliness is moderate but food was excellent We ordered the lobster sword fish fried rice chicken curry snow pea leaf with garlic and beef sautxc3xa9 everything was great So tasty and delicious I would recommend the fried rice and curry The potion size is huge Its best if you shareNever had a bad experience here The food is extremely authentic and if you come for lunch it literally arrives in seconds My favourites are the chicken feet shrimp dumplings and congee n  I understand that most people complain about the service but you have to understand that this isnt your typical American sitin restaurant nOverall great place for dim sum and Ill definitely be backFairly good food Lots of options for dimsum and they still have the carts Dinner is also very delicious We ordered scallops and broccoli garlic gai lan sweet and sour pork ginger beef crispy chicken and Cantonese chow mein Also reasonably priced 130 including tax and ti for 8 peopleThis is one of the Cantonese restaurants that I frequent in MississaugannI come mainly for the dim sum lunchnnWhat I like is the food is still pushed around on carts just like in the old school daysnAs a result you get to eat pretty quickly on your arrivalnOne thing to watch out for is because you are hungry on arrival you might tend to over order Like they say your brain is bigger than your stomach nnHowever no worries here as we pretty much always take home the left overs for our kidsHorrible parking actually had to park across the street and cross Hurontario   Mediocre dim sum cold and greasy  Abrupt service  And 50 more expensive than what I thought   Ill stick to Tremendous thankyouIve been to many authentic Chinese restaurants in my life This one is the best The staff is very professional and helpful the place is clean and the food is exceptional There is one TV screen and instead of the usual Highway TrafficCamera and the Breaking News they show clips of how traditional dishes are made in China I will definitely be back with more friendsFamilys Go To Dim Sum placennAlways a good time here People always complain about service  but you should know what youre getting into Its a dim sum place nnThe food never disappoints I cant even name a dish that wasnt good The cart dim sum give its that fun experience of the excitement of seeing the cart come by Whats in the cart Its great for kids and adults The price has gone up in the last couple of years but honestly its expected The food never disappoints and i will be back nnRecommendationsn For weekends come around 1030am Any later and youll be trapped in a crowd of chaos n The manager lady always tries to sell a couple dishes that she runs around with Dont get them They are usually the older items that wasnt soldn Theres an automatic charge for tea per person consider that when tipping n If there is a certain item you want and cant seem to find on the carts just ask the people in the black vest They can always preorder for you n be ready to eatThe food is horrible They should be embarrassed to serve this Had lemon chicken which was certainly cooked and served days before and rethermed for us Completely inedible Save your money and frustration Avoid this place at all costs45 StarsnI love Dim Sum so I decided to give Emerald a try and boy was I sure glad I did I came here for breakfast a few times and always came out happy  I also came here for dinner a few times  I hope this tells you just how much I love Dim Sum LOLnThe crispy squid was delicious crispy hot yummilicious and the roast duck was absolutely delicious Will definitely come here again Came in for lunch today but not for dim sum It was for my nephews baby moon so a ten course was orderednnThis is not in my neck of the woods either so I cant really compare it to other places in MississaugannSince it WAS dim sum hour it was really hectic At no fault of the restaurant though Customer service was still pretty good herennThe food was average we had the standard banquet dishes of crab claw ball garlic pea shoots steamed fish crispy chicken etc Nothing stood out and nothing was terrible nnWe did order a few dim sum dishes afterwards like chicken feet and siu mai nnI cant comment on the pricing either nnOverall it was alright but like I said Im never in Mississauga so Id only be back if there was a function thereIm a huge fan of Emerald In fact its a destination I rent a car to go there Its that good The selection the delicious hot sauce the pageantry Its all there to enjoy  Its the King of Dim Sum in the GTA as far as Im concerned Its always consistent and its authentic  I just avoid looking in the fish tanksThe service was nearly nonexistent and extremely rude Had 3 or 4 different servers come to our table and they would literally throw our plates on the table and leave without saying anything Our food came out one at a time there were 8 of us and there was probably 510 minutes in between each order It really was that bad Funny how all the other tables around us got great service and their food delivered in a timely fashion and all together NEVER going backFour out of Five stars for a traditional Chinese restaurant The decor and ambiance is what you would expect from such a place However it is our favorite place to go when we have a hunkering for DimSum The food is fresh and tasty Service is good and price is right A la cart is also very good and there are a lot of good traditional Chinese dishes same as you would find in China I enjoy Emerald Ask for TsingTao beer with your meal and try the pork belly and  and also the lobster dishesVery authentic chinese food Excellent service clean nice ambience  The decoration is typical to fine chinese restaurants in China  I have been in different parts of China several times so I can truly know when a place is authentic  The waiter who assisted us was very kind and trying and achieving his best to understand us and serve us good  The food was fresh tasty and good quality  Everything seemed clean and ambience mediummediumhigh class people  Is the type of chinese restaurant you will enjoy if looking for authentic and fine chinese food  Prices a bit high but the restaurant deserves it for the foodserviceambiance qualitynnSo far the best chinese restaurant we have found in Mississauga  We took our leftovers home happily and definitely going backHorrible place extremely dirty Could not drink water cuz glassses were gross Service was v bad cold food served Dont ever ever go thereOne a few that I know of dim sum restaurant in Mississauga on the way to the premium outletsnnCome before 11am as their was a huge back log after that even though the place is largennThis is a cart service place but a few items you have to order from the waiter en  Sui maipork dumplings which is a staple of dim sum food choices so go figure  they finally came and pretty smallnnAny ways had better in Markham and worse downtown toronto Chinatown so 3 stars is averageMy familys go to dim sum restaurant It gets quite busy on the weekends so expect a wait They have cart service until 1 pm but you can also order dim sum through the servers Food is always consistent and good Still cant find another dim sum restaurant that the whole family enjoysHorrible   just awful nNever go back again nOverpriced and low quality food and serviceWent for dim sum yesterday my first time for lunch and it sure was a different experience The restaurant was extremely busy but we still managed to get a table right away nnThe first thing I was confused about was how it worked I saw carts of food all around but only later realized thats how they serve you Also I had absolutely no idea how pricing worked for this and had to ask a waiter Even after that I wasnt sure as most of them cant speak English so it was hard to communicate nnThe food itself wasnt bad It tasted pretty decent but I wasnt impressed with anything just satisfied We tried a few things including chicken feet which was an interesting experience The spices on the chicken feet tasted good but there was almost no meat on it I guess that is expected but when I looked at the dish it looked more meaty I wish they had like another chicken dish with the spices they marinated and cooked the feet in nnOverall the experience was something new to me but the food doesnt leave me wanting more I was drinking water like crazy for the next 3 hours after as the meal left me extremely thirsty MSG nnI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you really want to try traditional dim sum onceThe food is okay I dont know if its kung pao chicken or the general tao but one of them tastes horrible The lemon chicken however tastes very good Its a normal tasting Chinese food that I find quite overpricedNarito kami kahapon  Dumating kami mga 1640  Liban sa aming

ngay ddal twens lang baliktanaw ko sa resto natioI took my clients here  The experience was the usual  We ordered a number of dishes  Unlike some other Chinese restaurants this location does not provide a complimentary pork bone Chinese soup to start  But they do provide complimentary red mung bean soupnnI was treating caucasian clients  I was very happy that they did not offend my clients asking if they wanted forks and knifes thank you  Eventually they needed and we were servednnWe were provided one pot of tea eventually two pots but the tea leaves were not replenished and so tea was quite washed and lightnnAt the end of our dinner we were served red mung bean soup  It was moderately sweet  It was okay but quite filling because its made with glutinous flour or just boiled too long that the tapioca has thickening it  I give the server props for observing my caucasian clients did not like it and quickly came to the rescue with fortune cookies to that my client were like Yea AwesomennIt could be five star but two reasons stopped mennFirst at a previous visit for dim sum I found that when I had caucasian clients with kids the servers take advantage of the kids amusement with crab claw dim sums because kids like playing with food  I will honestly say its pretty pricey to order half a dozen of premium dim sum dishesnnSecond this restaurant does not serve any dishes that are diabetichigh cholesterol customers  I can never take health sensitive clients for dim sum and the dinner options really dont have clean optionsThis place has hands down the worst food and service that I have experienced in a while nThe decor was super tacky The carpet chairs and the stage were all covered in a gold colour To top it off the cloth on the chairs was very dirty nThe servers could not care less about cracking a smile When asked for the dumping menu I was given a photo album with just pictures I then had to ask for another menu that had the description of dumplings Upon this the server got irritated nThe food was super gross The crab and corn soup had a bad fishy taste The chicken balls were 90 batter and 10 chicken They were also fried in an old oil The only thing that was decent was the scallop dumplings nPlease avoid this place at all costs I will not be returningIm told this restaurant has been around for numerous years and the rest of my party were regulars here Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant  golds and reds fish tank things werent new but not too old There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservationsnnThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular xc3xa0 la carte menu My table ordered off the xc3xa0 la carte probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we wantnnThe soup came out first  it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible but the taste was watery and bland It was also apparent the service was going to feature kindhearted ladies with fairtoaverage serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place literallynnOther dishes came out eventually featuring sweet and sour pork thousand island sauce deep fried pork egg tofu with baby shrimp garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce XO sauce string beans fish fillet with peasa collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected There were no foodrelated complaints around the table otherwise Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup  standard nothing specialnnI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing  my table of 16 came out to only 1650 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party Personally  I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill but for being in Mississauga it wasnt bad at allIve visited this place many times growing up  my parents have often used it as a goto for celebrating special occasions and family events and weve also dropped by for weekend dim sum many times When you get right down to it this place is basically a Chinese restaurant moonlighting as a banquet hall Very elaborate and ornate decor think gold seat covers seating to fill a legit army this place is huge  if youre looking to seat a large group this is a good place to start and good variety to the menu and dim sum carts nnIt isnt the cheapest dim sum spot in the area but if your main concern is making reservations and ensuring space for a larger group of people this is a safe bet The food itself is pretty decent  food from the menu is a decent size tasty and comes out quickly Theres good variety to the dim sum choices lots of dishes to choose from and the carts come by often nnOverall a decent choice Note they also take reservationsI went here today for dim sum and I love it The dim sum ordering style may be outside your comfort zone if youre not used to itnYou order food as you see them come around on carts flagging down workers and picking however many dishes you want from the cart They will mark down the types of dishes you got which will add to your total Different carts have different items but the same carts will come around quite oftennIts a great way to eat with your eyes picking food that looks good and they taste good too Highly recommend the deep fried squid tentacles a light crunch on the outside but soft and moist squid on the insideI travel all the way from Thornhill to Mississauga just to eat at Emerald because I enjoy the traditional experience of eating dim sum I find that the food is always fresh and there is always new items every time I go there The servers are friendly and theres good customer service The cha siu and the peking duck are a must when you go I highly recommend dining at this restaurant when youre in Mississauga and looking for authentic Chinese food Plus there is FREE WIFIIm shocked I havent reviewed this place This is my go to dim sum place on the weekend in the ssaugnnWho doesnt love carts of steaming bamboo containers being pushed around you Its packed though Go before 11am or after 1pm They serve dim sum until 4pm on the weekends Then it becomes a regular Chinese restaurant  I have totally made that mistake before although their chicken wasnt badnnThis places charges for tea so make sure you want tea before you ordered it It can get pricey and thats how a lot of dim sum places get younnI see some of the other reviewers saying how you had to be firm and you do All the cart ladies want to pawn their food on you Especially if you arent Asian Also if you want to order anything off the menu or even get extra napkins you will have to flag down one of the servers in the black vests They take their division of labour very seriouslynnYou should order a side of the stir fry snow peas They dont normally bring that out Its solidnnMy personal favourites are the scallop dumplings they are known for their scallop dishes seafood dumplings chicken feet crab claw and fried tofu wrapnnIm probably going this weekend Thinking about it makes me hungryCame here for dim sum today with family just me and 3 others We went very early on a Saturday at around 10am They were just beginning to roll out food and it didnt get busy until about noon The dim sum selection was good with lots of traditional dishes that other dim sum places dont make anymore I really liked the crab claw It was pretty tasty although not the best Ive ever had The same can be said about every other dish we had Good but not exceptional nnWhy wont I come back again Because the bill came out to 80 with tipand they charged me wrong originally so I had to go to the counter and talk to them before I got almost 30 refunded The service was mediocre A couple of time the carts almost went by and we had to flag it down to grab something off of it It wasnt the worst service but it certainly wasnt memorable either and at the prices they are charging compared to other parts of Toronto I was expecting moreTook my parents here recently to celebrate a birthday and left disappointed This place used to have great dimsum but now I no longer think its worth the drive The chicken feet was really good though so many if I have an exclusive craving for that Ill come back The service is a lot better rhan what it used to be and we were pleasantly surprised that the staff were friendly and attentiveIts been awhile since Ive visited this restaurant and I must say that this time around I actually enjoyed the food we ordered Its not exactly the best I ever had but comparing it to the food I had years ago at this place says a lotnnPrices are still up there in my opinion but then again a lot of produce are getting ridiculously expensive now a daysnnDecor needs an update if anyone cares And also theres a ton of seating in this place and the staff was attentive its hard to use the term friendly because they werent lol when we came in and our service was promptnnParking at the front of the restaurant can be busy but theres more parking around the back if the front is full nnOverall not the best one in Mississauga but its not bad place to go eitherVile  This was one of the worst examples of food quality out there The fried rice was just plain greasy but not fried and crispy like it should be  The lemon chicken was HARD and a funny color  so disgusting  It was dismal and inedible I would absolutely recommend you MISS this placeWasnt that great Taste of the food was blend Not authentic chinese food Ambiance very loud Servers were screaming among themselves and they forget they have customers who are close to them Been hurting our ears the whole time nWas weird seeing the lady server removing a fish from the tank to show a customer and kept talking with the fish still alive in her net Since the customer didnt want it she kept pushing it Then finally drop the fish back in the tank</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>gnKjwL_1w79qoiV3IC_xQQ</td>\n","      <td>Sushi Bars,

edamame Neither were anything special We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce Was not good at all The sushi was mediocre at best While they were friendly and the service was pretty good  I will not be backWent there Saturday noon they open at 12pm but people were waiting outside before 12pm so you can tell it should be a good place Nice Katsu  Eel with rice Many Japanese go thereWent to this restaurant on Saturday as I had a craving for a Japanese ramen It was packed for Saturday dinner We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll donkotsu ramen and katsu jyupork cutlet with egg nnAfter soft shell crab roll was served first we waited for 30minutes for other dishes They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waitingnnThe ramen was served and soup was very rich but saltyor was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accidentI liked the noodle though Katsu jyu was katsudon in a bento box style Katsu was okay not that crispy enough I maybe expected too muchauthentic japanese ramen and donkotsu as I heard the owner was Japanese They can do better nIt leaves a lot to be desired 3stars for the food and 2stars for the serviceThis place will always have a place in my stomaerrrheart  I have been coming here since high school and I had graduated in 05 woot  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping centernnI like Musashi as its small and intimate in there  They have booths tables a small bar but what I really like is to sit in their room  It looks like youd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor but there is openings for you to hang your feet  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the roomnnI prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck  When you go in during lunch make sure to look towards your right and youll see A B C lunch options  Those options arent on the menu and change daily  nnMy favorite thing to get here is the TonKatSu  Man on man  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life this would be it  It never disappoints  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing  If you think you cant get more salad dressingYOU CAN  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my hearts delightnnThe staff here is really nice and youll always see the same familiar faces when coming in  Come check them out  I promise youll enjoy their foodWell first time Ive really had authentic Japanese nonAmericanized no chicken covered in sugar sauce here The Chicken Katsu is what I laid my eyes upon and I was pleasantly surprised when it came out A good portion of chicken with many veggie and fruit options highly recommendnnThe place is small The service is courteous but slow Those are negative remarks that only hold it back slightly If you enjoy changing it up on your taste buds check it outI just came back from living in Japan for two years and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants Ive been to Not only that but the prices arent too bad either I had some kind of vegetarian nabe like a one pot dish and beef tongue my friend had the tonkatsu fried pork cutlets they gave more than one which was a surprise and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank maybe about 30 a person with tip and everythingnnThe atmosphere is nothing special Its a small restaurant in a strip mall but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style if thats your thing Personally Id rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant so I didnt mind at allnnAllinall I think Ill definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food thats a bit tough to find in CharlottennThe key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese which is always a good signFirst of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESEstyle sushi house If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture this will not be the restaurant for you nnJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan Americans and we southerners especially are not used to this type of service This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese If you eat lunch between 12PM you will have better servicennThe food is also VERY Japanese The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice If you are not accustomed to Japanese food then you may want a nonJapanese sushi bar like Sushi101 Mexican made or Rusans Indonesian made or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if thats your idea of sushinnI have eaten here every week for years It is a small restaurant with basic rolls They are very consistent and the food is always excellent I have never gotten brown wasabe or fish that I didnt know what it was The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll a maki roll soup salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about 8nnI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture Now that I have explained it to you maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashis great food If great service is most important to you find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai HouseLocated in a small plaza is an authentic Japanese restaurant Very small establishment but has a seating area where you can sit down and feel like your in a Japanese house Service was excellent got seated immediately and food came out really quickly faster than Sonics Limited on choices for lunch but all was excellent Soft rice to crispy katsu equals great quality Will be coming back again to try others on the menu Recommend the KatsuDon and Katsu CurryWaiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before It was rather salty instead  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback In any case Im not giving Musashi up yet since its close to home cooking nn030317 A Friday DinnernDisappointed It was packed tonight Had to wait about 15 mins for a table Then had to wait 4550 for our food But the waiting wasnt the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile WRONG nnThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right  cut thick n all the same size I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA No MSG No thirst after the meal And the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco nnTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters Hmm I guess Im ole fashion n lived in Japan too long nnI also ordered three uni sashimi Hey Whats with the same price of 350 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi But I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi qualitynnWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG lots n lots nnThe tempura shrimp was perfect not doughy or undercooked nnStill since its near Im not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next timeTonkatsu RamennITADAKIMASnnThis place is authentic nYoull find several decent types of sake and small plates here from Shisamo to hamachi kamanif you have not had either you should try it Their agedashi tofu is also awesomennThey have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen The tonkatsu is good but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorfulnnI had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for moreWe decided to try Musashi on Friday night after reading some other Yelp reviews and Im happy to say it was a great experience  Everyone in there seemed like regulars several were commenting that it was busier than usual on a Friday night and some seemed to have their table  Just like another reviewer said I always take it as a good sign when I visit an ethnic restaurant and see it full of people from that ethnicity  We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic and awesomennThe service was a little slow and disorganized so thats the only reason I cant give Musashi 5 stars  I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner that came with rice and miso soup and it was fantastic  We also had the vegetable spring roll appetizer  My food arrived to the table about 15 minutes prior to my husbands sushi  Wouldve been nice to eat together but it wasnt a deal breaker  Like I said a little disorganized but otherwise very good  nnWe will definitely go back to Musashi  great food authentic experience and well pricedIm a huge fan of Japanese and Ramen and growing up in Hawaii  its hard to find what I like This place is like someones grandma made food for you its the best Its not super fancy greatness of the food is mostly in how its done and whats in it It is  well prepared yummy and delicious  Its not going to break my bank because its fancy  Its simple I have hit every ramen place in town and this is the place I go to 90of the timeAwesome We had the fried baby crabs they were so good that we placed a second order I could have eaten just those for dinnernnHubby had the Sushi Deluxe plate and enjoyed the chefs selections I ordered the Chirashi and it was greatnnI have to mention their salmon It was fresh buttery and utterly delightful Im craving it now that Im typing thisnnTheir service was prompt and friendly The restaurant is small but efficientnnWe have found our new favorite sushi in Charlotte and will be at Muashi Japanese Restaurant oftenIve been visiting this restaurant only because this is the only place I can get Japanese home style dishes such as Katsuju Tenju or grilled fish with rice and misoshiru nnDecent Japanese restaurants would put some grated daikon with grilled fish Especially for these prices Everything is so skimpy and jobs are sloppy nnService You dont have to take your dishes fromto kitchen Thats all about itnnThis place used to be filled with Japanese business persons after work and Japanese families Not many Japanese customers now No wondernnI keep praying for a decent authentic Japanese restaurant coming to Charlotte For now I just drive to the Triangle Its worth 25 hour drivingJapanese owned Japanese restaurant nI had a Chirashi couple of days ago it was very goodnThey have verity of Japanese food not only teriyaki sushi or rollsn5 starsIm a fan of their food  service is a different story I have been here on several occasions and theres always a stone cold looking older Japanese lady who never cracks a smile Honestly Im more scared of her than anything else The other ladies are nicer but please keep in mind language is a definite barrier ex asking for anything more than the basics will likely not get you any answer Having a large party in that tatami room is nice but it is not the best idea during Friday  Saturday nights peak time lets just say it can be very chaoticnnWith that being said I love their food Its my friends favorite place for ramen and Japanese homecooking They have some sushi but not a big selection Personally I prefer nigiri and sashiminnThey have a Japanese menu  I found out from my parents Chinese friends Again communicating with the waitstaff is difficult but its worth the work to order something differentThis is my second time here and both times the waitresses have been rude Especially the older cockeyed lady Weve waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger tabletatami styled table because we had a party of 7 Her response was uh no  I didnt understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away The first time I went after waiting an hour one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldnt be seated It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible They need a bigger entrance a hostess and better management They didnt give us enough menus or silverware and didnt ask what we wanted to drink The floor is extremely sticky not sure why I guess they dont clean the floors As for the food I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses If you still decide to go try the tenpura lunch or katsujyu I tried to give them a second chance but Ive never felt this disrespected before Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future Not happy at all Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didnt provide me with one How disappointingVery authentic Japanese restaurant in the area Im a native JapanesenFriendly service and nice atmospherenBento box is a very good valuenWould be nice if they had more appetizer optionsThis place is a hidden gem Ive heard of this place but never really took the time to stop This place is pretty authentic The decor is even authentic The place is small and the tables are close together I decided to get ramen with the miso broth It was savory and delicious It was filling and just plain good My husband got the sushi platter and he was pretty pleased with it He said it was very fresh Overall this place is good Please note they do not do any substitutionsFood is honestly really good The place to go for ramen in the Queen City Huge Downside is the Service  Eating out is an experience and they clearly havent figured this outI love sushi and japanese food  I was looking for a gem  My wife and I tried Musashi and she got food poisoning from the teriyaki chicken  My sushi was decent but it did not make up for the chicken  Obviously  Granted this dinner was a few months ago so hopefully they have improvedThis was my first trip to Musashi  I ordered the pork ramen and my girlfriend ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetable udon  We also ordered an eggplant in light sauce appetizer Everything was extremely good  The ramen seemed extremely authentic  It even had one of those little fish cakes in it The udon was the best I have had in town  nnI will definitely go back and try their sushi and order more soup even though it is about a 25 minute drive for me to get thereI acquired a taste for Japanese food during my frequent business trips to South East Asia and Japan In India it is impossible to find good Japanese food without paying eyepopping prices When I moved to the US in 2009 Id expected to be much better off Columbia SC where I worked was not exactly the big city Id hoped to live in and dining options were very limited So Charlotte is where I ventured for some varietynnMusashi is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte I used to stop by here every time I drive through Charlotte or would come to the Charlotte airport to pick up my girlfriend I moved to Charlotte in 2010 and thought that Id be a regular visitor after that The 1011 mile drive from uptown where I stay meant that I actually visited them even less frequently than when I lived in ColumbiannId say that the Sushi has gotten better here from what I remember from my 1st visit in 2009 But the real treats here are the Ramen love the Tonkatsu Ramen and the Japanese menu my faves are the Fish Liver and the Beef  Tofu Ingredients are topnotch For example just try the fried squid  perfectly cooked and the best quality that Ive had anywhere including Singapore nnMy girlfriend had been very relucatant to try Japanese food because she was always worried about using chopsticks One visit to Ippudo NYC convinced her that she needed to eat more Japanese food We went to Musashi twice this weekend when she flew down to visit me  Sat lunch and Sun dinner So now she is a convert toonnIt is not cheap But Id say that it is great value for money  you do get more than what you pay for Excellent service nice traditional kind of ambience that is way more than the outside strip mall exterior might suggest And most of all fantastic food that I will miss when I move from Charlotte in April Authentic Japanese food in a friendly atmospherennWe had the savory tonkatsu ramen crispy and moist katsu chicken and perfectly sliced and fried vegetable tempura for dinner  Starters were gyoza get two orders these went so fast potato croquettes and age dashi tofu  Real green tea was a very pleasant surprise toonnI suppose the true testament to the quality of the food was the customer base over 50 Japanese touristsvisitors in the time we were thereThis restaurant seems actually run by Japanese people which is rare for a Japanese restaurant in the US It also seems to receive a good number of Japanese regulars which is always a good sign I see theyre trying to be authentic in their food I lived in Japan and I can tell nnAnyway the ramen I tried I guess you just cant make it as good as youd get in Japan It is pretty ordinary ramen stuff you could make with the material you gather from an asian market without much efforts but pricey not as meh and pricy as the ones I tried in St Marks Place in NYC though those were absolute ripoffs and were literally cupnoodles in bowls nnThe lunch sushi plate I didnt try but I saw a sample display at the entrance  the usual cheapie American style sushi ie a bunch of makis easy to make a bunch easier to cheat the flavor of lower quality sashimi not accidentally never ever seen served in restaurants in japan fake crab meats seriously why would any supposedly authentic japanese restaurant serve this crap Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive etcnnOK food Really not much better but certainly not worse than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte and the prices were OK The Japanese regulars seems to frequent the place because they know it cannot get any better in Charlotte as far as Japanese cuisine goes not because the food there is as good as theyd get back home So what can you doBest authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte The sushi is always fresh and delicious From simple rolls like the California roll to their more complex and modern rolls like the Yankee Roll is delicious Everything else on the meal is great Ive had their ramen katsu almost everything and its delicious nnIt is a small restaurant so I would call and make a reservationnnThey also have specials and certain items that arent on their menu Just ask if you want to try something new and excitingThey have very fresh sushi for a good price  Very yummy ramen too  My hubby and I went there for the second weekend now  We like to sit at the bar and watch the sushi chef work and they are also quick with excellent serviceVery disappointed after reading the generous reviews about the authenticity We really wanted to like this place as a sushiAsian alternative to some of our favorites including Sushi Guru Tsuki Futo Buta Asian18 etcand much prefer the freshness and service they offernnThe staples to Japanese food are rice which was good and seafood which was of mediocre quality Most portions were small and pricey and not impressive The limited lunch menu left a lot to be desired with many popular items only on the dinner menu such as teriyaki salmon sushi ramen etc we had to ask for sushi menus which seemed to be a rare exception nnWe may try dinner or carry out hesitantly and try to naviagate the good parts of their menu if they let us Good luck to Masushi and their customersA must tryThis is an adorable place with very friendly staff The food was excellent I had the teriyaki plate Everything on the plate was to die for My husband got the bento box a little bit of everything He came away stuffed Even with me stealing samples  Picky eater daughter got he Ramen bowl and loved itAll I have had is the ramen Thats all I need to know I had shoyu ramen and it was amazing Flavorful broth and great chew to the noodles Love the bok choy and pork tooThey are one of the few if not the only Japanese familystyle restaurant in the South Charlotte  Uptown area  With only 10 tables served by three wait staff during peak hours be prepared for a small wait for a table at weekends nnThey have lunch sets that change on a daily basis which offer a good choice of salads sushi and small bites We also enjoy coming here in the evenings and ordering from the Izakaya style Japanese menu that includes a good selection of grilled fish saury mackerel and hokke Their sushi is also ok but it wont knock you off your chair in terms of freshness and tasteFamily went to Mizuho and found that it was closed 71110 This was a huge letdown  seems another sushi restaurant with a different name is taking its place  will just have to wait and see how it turns outnnAnyway we went to Musashi as a second choice and it was not nearly as nice as Mizuho Atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy I ordered Sushi Deluxe which was OK and came with miso soup but no salad as most places serve and a Kirin beer Wife ordered individual nigiri with spicy tuna roll  also OK And daughter ordered teriyaki chicken  poor at best chicken breast apparently baked with sauce poured on top very plain salad small amount of noodlesand bowl of rice The girls chose water to drink Despite below average restaurant and food service was very goodnn75 Sushi is expensive and that is OK but this was too much for below average atmosphere and food Add a tip and the meal was nearly 90  last trip to MusashinnSo the search is on for good sushi in South CharlotteI have given up on Japanese food in CharlottennAny restaurant that fails to acknowledge the customer for over 5 minutes is never going to be good in my book Musashi makes it easy by serving average food to go with their incredibly crappy servicennWe came in the door and waited by the register for over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us The place is pretty small so its not like they couldnt see us The sushi chefs kept looking at us but never moved a muscle to signal the waitresses that we were waitingnAfter we sat down we ordered beer which arrived soon but after that the service was back to crap nnWe ordered tamago sushi which never arrived and we had to ask another waitress to get it because our original waitress simply stopped attending tables The tamago was quite good nnI got the Udon which was basically chicken broth and noodles with a little green onions sprinkled on it A monkey can be more creative than that and I certainly did not enjoy paying 9 for it It had no taste no spices not even any soy sauce in it It was literally broth and noodles I showered it with their chilli flakes so I could trick myself into thinking it was eatablennOh and the service wasnt bad for all customers  these two Japanese guys came in and the wait staff fell over each other trying to please them Every other table was being ignored but these two basically got personal slaves to take care of them They never had to ask for anything the waitress was hovering over their table every 3 minutes nnThe service pissed me off and I would never go back even though their sushi is pretty goodThis is a no frill authentic Japanese restaurant that is generally filled with Japanese and other Asians If you are looking to order fancy drinks and Americanized California rolls this is not the place for you Go to Nikko in South End for the Upscale experience and super expensive SushinnI believe this is now the only place in Charlotte where you can order really good Bento Boxes and authentic Ramen Noodle bowls Mai Japanese Restaurant used to have good Bento boxes when they were at South Blvd location but they have abandoned Bento Box since they have moved to Colony Road location  nnSushi here are very fresh and there are plenty of Japanese appetizers on the menu in English and Japanese The service is typical of small family run restaurant  They tend to get overwhelm when it is too busy  nnMango Mochi is our children favorite dessert We try to go here once or twice a monthMy girlfriend and I have been coming here for a while now Finally leaving a review for this awesome Japanese restaurant Ive tried just about everything on the menu and Musashi never disappoints If you authentic Japanese ramen and not the ramen fusion thats around town you have to come here its top notch Their sushi is spot on and you cant go wrong with their bento box offerings We come here at least once a week so goodMy wife and i dine in here for dinner First off they do not keep in track of first in first serve We kind of had to guess who is next Also order 1 bottle of sake and  2 chirashi dinner which costed 2199 each And they gave us soo little sashimi and portions did match the price And the lady didnt even give us water for frist 15mins and before we even finished eat she handed us a check Not even buffet places hand yoh5check before u ask And we didnt even stay more than 40mins total And didnt want to stay any longer I would give this place 0 star if i couldBest place for authentic AsianJapanese food Must try the ramen bowl and bento box Great sushi tooI used to visit Japan often to meet customers Ive eaten at Rameen places where a bowl costs 4 and is a full meal to the fancy sushi places that are Gaijin traps where prices can run to over 100 per head easily for a good mealnnMusashi is an unpretentious genuine Japanese place that bring back the best of authentic Japanese food to me Except for the Sushi The only Sushi Ive liked here is the Ikura Of course they have some rolls on the menu for the Gaijin  which made me sceptical when I first visited But a quick Sumimasen did the trick and I got good advice on what is best on the menu Got chided on my 2nd visit for drinking Sake for lunch but explained that my friend had never had tried it They were most welcoming of me when I came on my own and I was most embarrassed and ignored by them when I visited this place with my girlfriend  because she is exactly the sort of Gaijin whod insist on ordering Sushi rolls and ignore their wonderful Tonkatsu rameennnSo to cut it short this is a place only if you like genuine Japanese holeinthewall kind of places If you are looking strictly for Sushi Id still recommend the Tamago and the Ikura over any other place within 100 milesI love this restaurant  The best Japanese menu in the city  It is not trendy or fusion  just good traditional Japanese family restaurant foodLunch ReviewnnWe pulled up at 1145 am to discover that they didnt open till 12 for lunch We waited patiently in the car At 12 pm the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in The restaurant itself is pretty tiny There were a few booths two small 2top tables a few larger tables pushed together and a separate traditional dining area for larger partiesnnThey had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register I ordered the lunch special A  rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen The beau ordered the miso ramen Overall I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his It really wasnt anything to rave about though Pretty standard Definitely not the best ramen Ive had but hey It was Charlotte good nnA few things I found annoying The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best I wont be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramenI went at about 630p on a Monday The service was prompt and courteous I wasnt rushed I thoroughly enjoyed the umeshiso maki with an entrxc3xa8e  of katsujyu and miso soup Ill be back with friends and family

place has the unfortunate distinction of serving up the worst toro Ive ever hadinstead of butter I got coal  That aside the sashimi is serviceable and generally as fresh as Charlotte gets  The specials will almost always be a fantastic deal You will always have two options to choose fromand while people may hold subconscious grudges against the letter B I can assure you that electing special B will not detract from your dining experience whatsoever  My parents and sister love the mackerel here if thats your thing I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba nnI also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly  Like Kabernet Sabignykind of weird  That was sort of endearingnnOf course its plagued by the same service problems and dour server expressions that other Asian restaurants have which still can be a bit of a shock in the land of sunshine and Southern hospitalityMusashi is by far the best Japanese Restaurant nnMy choices are from the appetizer are nnShrimp Shumai Steamed shrimp dumplings and Shrimp Tempura Lightly battered fried shrimp  vegetable  yes I order these two items for my appetizer every time we come  I dont care it was an amazing flavor real Japanese style Shumai and Tempura it is a perfection nnThen I would then order my favorite soup  nnTonkotsu Pork bone base  Japanese egg noodle w roasted pork slices bamboo shoot  green onions Cant complete the heavenly dinner without my favorite soupnnnand for the Main nnThe bento box is the best option You could choose from chicken beef or pork or salmon nnI always choose either Chicken or Beef Teriyaki but the best thing about BENTO BOX is that it has everything in it pretty much maybe pricey but it is worth the  paid for because it was damn excellentMy favorite authentic Japanese food in town Its a small family owned restaurant Love their lunch specials They usually have two or three different lunch specials every day with generous portion at a very reasonable price Every dish from agedashi tofu tonkasudon ramen nabeyaki udon to cold soba with tempura is simply deliciousIve been going to this place from the beginning This is TRUE Japanese food Ramen Curry Sushi etc is authentic and not made like youd get at a asian fusion place Id say if you come with an open mind about the sushi youd like it otherwise stick with the Ramen and Gyoza cant go wrong there nnService can be a bit scattered but everyone is very friendly this is a family owned restaurant so its not always ran efficiently But in the end you come to a restaurant for the food not the great service ala Peter Lugers With that said everyone that has worked in their is quite friendlyThe food is better than average and affordably priced but service is extremely slow and theres no rhyme or reason as to when dishes come out of the kitchen  They dont answer their phone any time of day and dont return calls so its nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement  nnBut its a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4  Thats probably their focal point anyway  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad if expensive sake selection  nnI would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or moreMusashi is my favorite spot in Charlotte for authentic ramen or a bento box lunch The sushi is also good  the fish is always fresh and the portions are generous The servers never have much to say but I cant complain since service is fast and Im there for the food The BEST service Ive had in a long time All of our food was made to order I just loved that The inside is small the staff is friendly and the prices are greatMy family has been a repeat customer and huge fans of this place for as long as I can remember  I really dont think you can go wrong with anything on this menu the food is authentic as so many people have said below and doesnt disappoint  The setup of the restaurant is nice and the servers are extremely nice and friendly  I love a good bento box or bowl of ramen from here  And out of all the sushi Ive ever had theirs is definitely at or at least very near the top of my list  You can always count on this place for a satisfying lunch or dinnerTerrible  Very disappointing We went for ramen and it was very plain and tasteless  Hard boiled egg instead of pickled  Dry pork instead of pork belly Asked if they could make just a plate of noodles for our 3 year old and she said no  We dont have noodles  Well what is in your ramen  Services was just plain rudeVery authentic japanese restaurant  We ordered curry rice sushi dinner a ramen and katsu don  And some appetizersnnSushi rolls the right way katsu tastes like authentic and agedashi was good toonnGyoza was excellent something I havent had the best for long time  You can tell they are home madennCurry I m suspecting that they use the curry blocks you buy from market but nonetheless it tastes good  But its pricey for its servingnnRamen is still not the best I had  They use lean pork  The broth is just ok  The whole thing is average but not overly disappointed  I m a big fan of ramen and I rate this over yama in midwood and futo buta  Need to try the yume bistro nextAwesome sushi great environment only two servers and yet they still managed to help us and get us everything on time amazing place definitely coming backCame back for Ramen and so very glad I did This place had some absolutely delicious ramen that was flavored and cooked to perfection I am not a ramen expert but its the best Ive had in Charlotte nnAgain their other food is good and authentic and while I originally said I wasnt blown away I feel like it might be a slight injustice The food at Musashis is made to be good Its kind of like when your mom or grandmother cooks You know you love it and it tastes amazing to you but its not something you see in a fancier establishment so you dont feel impressed However it is exactly that good and tastes great and thats what you get from MusashisSo happy to find this place in Charlotte  I never thought I would find authentic Japanese food made by Japanese in North Carolina  And its really good too  I had some of the best Tonkatsu ever and my mom is Japanese  My husband had the Chicken Katsu which was breast and is always a plus  He said it was so tender and crispy  I also had the Ika Karaage which was fried crispy yet was not tough at all  I cant wait to go back and try something else  nnService was fast for a small place  They all work together as a team and it showsA group of friends and I had a great time at Musashi  We were in the elevated room with floor seating  I have not had traditional ramen soup before  it was great  I think we were probably a little much for the typical crowd there so maybe dont show up with a ton of bros in towAuthentic Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location Fresh and generously sliced sashimi lightly breaded tempura done right not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp flavorful ramen and noodles and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes including the light misobased salad dressing We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers tofu was divinenot overly cooked then a sashimi platter a ramen an udon a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly wkimchee dish an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe its a Korean dish but wonderfully prepared nevertheless None of the dishes were too sauceheavy or overly fried and the soupsbroths were not too salty As a result you could actually taste the foodwhat a conceptIm a Japanophile myself and I LOVE Musashi As far as I know it is the only place to find real authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional usually for big parties To most the staff doesnt seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba  which was great I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment The only setback is that I live so far from itWe have been here a couple of times with overall good experience I would recommend people try everything my Japanese coworker told Musashi might be the best Japanese in townlolJust like youre in Japan  Food is fantastic and 100 authentic  Prices are great for lunch normal for dinner  Be sure to check the A and B lunch choices when you walk in  Theyre always displayed up front with plastic wrap on themnnSome things to expect that are a little uniquenClosed on TuesdaynDoesnt open until 12pm closed between lunch and dinnernOrders come out when ready for each person not all at oncenSmall restaurant normally pretty crowdedGreat traditional Japanese spot If you want to taste more than sushi and discover the greatness of Japanese cuisine his is the right place nLunch specials filling and affordable friendly servers It gets busy most days bc is good and a small restaurant so be patient and e joy your foodIf you want authentic Japanese come here I absolutely love Sue and the sushi chef They are so sweet and awesome Great Japanese food Nice decor cute place very great service The miso and pork bone ramen were really good but just a little bit more expensive than what Im used toThis is as close as it gets in this town Good variety of standards and super friendly environmentThis place has delicious authentic Japanese ramen The gyoza are delicious I always get the pork ramen tonkatsu A bowl of happiness  I have yet to try their sushi or teriyaki  but it looks so good It is always full of happy customers I love MusashiI hate to give a bad review on a rare restaurant thats actually run by Japanese people apparently but it just wasnt a good food The sushi set I ordered was a typical Americanized sushi affair Not authentic at allnnI also dont know where they find their cooks but I seriously doubt the Japanese guy behind the sushi counter was properly trained in the sushi making at least not in Japan Just because the guy is a Japanese doesnt make him any kind of sushi master Its a profession not a nationality He also was very slow in making his sushis I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter Not only he doesnt seem like a proper sushi cook his workattitude was not professional at all They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customersWe were there around 6PM the place was empty  I had second doubt about this place since it was situated in a questionable location We were greeted by an older lady assuming she was the owner not the warmest greeting we had ever received Few minutes had passed the server came to take our drink order We ordered large hot sake  a bottle of Sapporo The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave Fine I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer maybe the sake machine wasnt turn on We ordered edamame  fried squid legs They were both just ok nothing really stood out For the main course we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen  a sushi roll For the ramen this is legit  The broth is light  rich not thick like other place Only complaint was an overcooked egg The roll  Wife ate all of it since it had eel  I didnt really care for  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro ika hamachi spider roll futo maki Nothing was short of excellence  Dont mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish the quality was out of this world This had to be the best quality we ever had if you look at my review we had also tried Nobus Aspen You know we are foodies We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total all of which were the best Overall if you rate this place less than 5 stars you are crazyI really enjoy Japanese food and had heard how authentic Musashi was Well that is true It is authentic and just as bland as some of the Japanese restaurants in Japan The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory It just had no spice at all to it Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it it became a decent meal If this was available at pho prices I would be back However with that dish costing 15 Id rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at homeAfter hearing my dad rave about this place we decided to do his birthday dinner here He doesnt rave about anything which means it has to be good He used to work for a Japanese company and they would frequent this place after work nnIm a Japanese food novice so I let my dad order everything Their menu is simple and so is their layout Just two ladies were serving a packed restaurant and they really kept up quite well But you dont care about that THE FOOD WAS AMAZING Im excited to add Musashi to my regular rotationFirstly this is one of rare few actual Japanese restaurants operated by Japanese people This is the closest experience you will get in the CharlottePineville area as if you were served in Japan Ive had their Udon  cold Soba Noodles and they are both delicious It make me feel as if I was back in Japan They are well know for their bento box chicken Katsu nnIf you strive for an accurate Japanese food experience then look no furtherSo this place comes highly recommended It is behind my favorite ThaiVietnamese place VietThai and once night we thought wed check it outnnWe had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken Everything was good but I wasnt blown away I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time but it has a sesame dressing I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese That speaks volumes  FYI he loved the place but didnt think his chicken was the best We both agreed wed be back to try the Ramen and UdonI really enjoyed my dinner crazy tuna roll and a smoked salmon nigiri that made me so happy I became lonesome once I realized I had eaten it alreadynnAs soon as we walked in there was a super adorable lady ready to tend to us nnEveryone was very attentive and amiable Im a very satisfied customernnThe place is very small but very nice and clean I plan on coming backPretty tasty and very authentic For some reason it was white guyAsian wife night plus kids Good thing my hubs and I fit in Also I need to brush up on my Japanese so I can read the secret menuNot a place to die for  good sushi place is hard to come by in Charlotte especially in the Ballantyne area  Fish here is ok not much selection  Noodle tastes like the ones from package  But the cutlets are good had it few times  had their bento box disappointed by the portion they give you and the price they charge made me feel like I was paying the NYC priceI found this restaurant through Yelp and I saw that people really liked the ramen Now I have been to Japan and the best ramen I have had in the US was in DC I was not sure what to expect when we went to Musashi From the outside it looked like a cheap place with maybe adequate sushi The inside was a whole different story It felt genuine and warm All the food items sounded delicious Nothing was too salty or greasy The stuff we ordered tasted great I got the miso ramen which was super flavorful The tempura shrimp was very juicy It was not like some restaurants where the fried part overpowers the taste of the actual food Definitely try out this restaurant4 years later since my initial review and nothing has changed I love love love Musashi I highly recommend coming here for lunch which for me means my Saturday lunches are usually here They usually do 3 specialty lunch boxes Box A B and C A is usually a unique homemadeesque Japanese dish Sometimes it is katsu curry Other times it is ramen Sometimes its a little of both and other times its a bento box Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl My usually order the A as it is always unique authentic and delicious Other recommendations are katsudon katsu with egg and onions over rice grilled mackerel chicken katsu and agedashi tofuFirst off we WILL return  This place is pretty solid on humble authentic atmosphere and recipepresentation  It is obviously a favorite of the JapaneseAmerican population of CharlottennAfter many good Yelpers guided us to this spot we decided finally to give it a try  A busy spot and a small restaurant  It did not appear that they took reservations Im not sure  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six  Dress in layers this tiny joint gets cozynnWe plan to try more sushi varieties its right in line with prices from other places  Its very fresh straightforward presentation  Timing on food coming out is decent we didnt wait forever  We had a couple of rolls and they were good  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive  My 11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting  Next time I will probably try a bento box  My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and was pretty satisfiednnThe service staff is so very nice and cheerful  If you know Japanese my husband does they love to make conversationWent to this place to order the Ramen that everyone has raved aboutits too bad that I could not focus on enjoying the ramen because the place was just too dirty and grimy I sat in a booth close to the wall and thought for sure I would catch a fungus just by sitting too close to the dirty wall The table was also sticky and gross  There sanitation score was a 90 and something tells me thats pretty high for them The ramen was just okbut I think if you cant properly clean your tables and your walls  that something even more disgusting disturbing and dirty is lurking in the kitchen  I was not impressed and will never go backMy husband and I lived in Shanghai and have traveled to Japan several times We knew the moment we walked in that this place was legit One menu only in Japanese very traditional decor and fantastic food So happy to have true taste of home for us here in Charlotte We moved to Charlotte in Summer 2013 and we are so blessed to find this restaurant I worked for a Japanese company and I have taken several Japanese guests to this place All of them claimed that the dishes are very original and they felt that they are in TokyonnOur family eats at this place once a week Chirazi sushi Agedashi tofu tonkatsu and ramenudon are our typical orderI was long anticipating going to Musashi to try the BBQ eel It was the only place I could find that had bbq eel however it was only ok especially for 20 It came with a miso soup and was served on white rice nothing special Service was fast for takeout I am willing to try again and want to try the ramen not available for takeout But right now Im not overly impressedGood Japanese food The ramen is really good Curry with pork chop is also my favorite Lunch time food is decent Weekend night could be crowded and you should expect long wait timeSo far Ive only had the ramen but it is so delicious Honestly I started craving real restaurant ramen while I was watching Naruto and it was as good as I could have imagined and Im so glad I found a place thats in the area I also tried their steamed dumplings as an appetizer and they tasted incredibly freshMy boyfriend and I loved this place We both love authentic oriental food and this is at the top of the list now The people were all great fast servers and the food was delicious nnSome highlights to our meal wa the miso soup not made from a packet and the sushi This will definitely be a new regular place for usnnMake sure to get there early because it is a small location and fills up quickly in the eveningSo I came in for 1 thing the eel bowl Thats what I got and thats all I got I expected it to be served with wasabi or ginger but nope literally eel and rice I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce they didnt have any I was kind of disappointed Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers What it all really boils down to is how good is that eel Let me tell you its one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things Ive put in my mouth The eel was cut to perfection huge portions might I add In fact its hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that arent cut up Because it was cooked whole it makes the eel that much more tender If youve never had eel you must try it It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia grilled with eel sauce and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness nBut seriously I need shrimp sauce or white sauce Next time I may order it Togo and get shrimp sauce from somewhere else Problem solvedI think my expectations were a little to high on this one I was looking for some good ramen and decided to drive across town to Musashi Unfortunately I was not thrilled with the ramen there It was not bad but not what I was looking for I also ordered a spicy tuna roll The roll was overpowered by mayo and was not for me The service however was good and the staff was friendly Just to many other better sushi places around townI asked the cashier at Hatoya for an authentic Japanese restaurant she gave me MusashinnMy friend and I immediately wanted to check the restaurant out only to find out that they open at 530pm  We came back at 635pmnnPlace  The establishment is small but gosh it was packed on a Friday night at 645pm One thing I have learned is to make reservations It looked like almost more than half of the tables had Reserved signs  There were people behind us waiting for a table some leftnnFood n Tonkotsu Ramen I was craving for some ramen and the ramen I had ordered was alright I was hoping for the one I had tried in NewYork or the one in Houston  The flavor of the pork Tonkotsu Ramen was there but just missed the mark on presentation and other ingredients Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte n Tonkatsu Bento Box My friends husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box n Katsu Chicken Entree My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright  n Salad The salad ginger peanut dressing was goodn Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll Just shrimp tempura and the roll no other veggies  whatnnService  They are good about getting to you when you ask for their service  When they are busy it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to younnPrice  Was alright not too shabby and reasonable at best nnSo bottom line I like the food but I am in no dire need to come back I would be happy to have their food at the Japanese Festival though   I felt bad for the people who waited around the door for the next available seattable  My friends and I quickly paid for our dinner after we were done so they could be seatedVery enjoyable evening  Fantastic service by the wait staff and entertaining performance by the chef  Would recomend for a good change of pace from the normWhenever I am in Charlotte I practically BEG my friends to take me to Musashi For three years I have gone to this Japanese Restaurant for their Miso Ramen and croquettes Both of which are truly amazing Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it and the broth is fantasticnnMy last visit which was last Thursday I finally got to sample their sushi I have some Unagi BBQed Eel and some Ebi Cooked shrimp with some vinegar I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any mealnnThe atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant it is closed off by some sliding doors It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to itnnThe Staff is always friendly and kind and you really could not ask for any better They always feel very attentive to their customers If your glass of tea is nearly empty someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill itnnMusashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina It is a shame it is so far away from me but its worth the trip when I am in the area if you are looking for some fantastic sushi tempura or ramen this is the place to goThis is a completely legit traditional Japaneseowned sushi restaurant which is a bit of a rarity anywhere in the United States outside of a major city like NY LA Chicago DC or Miami let alone North Carolina There are fancier LOOKING sushi places to be found in this town for sure but purist Japanese sushi that caters to a very Japanese and Asian crowd Youd be hard pressed to find more than a few of these at allnnThe lunch special is great especially the Chirashi Sushi which is pieces of sashimi on top of a bowl of seasoned sushi rice The tempura appetizer is perfect with just the right amount of coating and a real ponzu dipping sauce with daikon radish in it nnThis is not a place for fancy Americanized rolls Order traditional stuff or just watch what the regulars are eatingMy favorite authentic Japanese food in town Its a small family owned restaurant Love their lunch specials They usually have two or three different lunch specials every day with generous portion at a very reasonable price Every dish from agedashi tofu tonkasudon ramen nabeyaki udon to cold soba with tempura is simply deliciousAfter a visit to San Francisco Chinatown to eat Ramen noodles I had a huge craving for real ramen noodles  A friend of mine recommended Musashi as an authentic Japanese restaurant so I decided to give it a trynnI ordered the udon noodle soup and it was almost what I remember eating in San Francisco  I also ordered a small roll just to try the sushi   Both were excellent  nnIts great that we can get authentic Japanese food in Charlotte  I just wish it wasnt such a drive for meVery authentic for the area   However I wouldnt exactly call this 100 authentic   It is definitely the most authentic weve had in NC   There was a line out the door and only one server so we waited over 20 minutes before even speaking to someone  We were seated but only received one menu so we shared it   We were served after four other tables that arrived after us  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea  The tea seems powdered   Husband got Shoyu Ramen and I wanted chicken katsu curry but the chicken katsu is 8 apparently its five additional dollars for the curry sauce  So i ordered the Tempura instead   It was very good  We also got pork shumai but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom  His noodles were very good firm stretchy chewy delicious   Very good flavor in the broth  nnWe will be back to give this place another shot they just seemed a bit too busy and a little understaffed  Also we wont order the shumai again it just didnt seem right to usMusashis is our go to spot for authentic Japanese The staff is owned and run by a Japanese family  huge plus especially nowadays where youve got all these japanese restaurants run by Chinese Korean or the East Asian people Its always a good sign when you see other Japanese diners dining there The ambience is simple and unassuming allowing the food to speak for itself The food here is AUTHENTIC The sushi chef is intimidating looking and very serious about what he does The sushi and sashimi are all very good  chirashi bowl sashimi a la carte uni yellowtail salmon roe salmon tuna Their rolls taste fantastic too We always go with the spicy yellowtail Cali rolls and soft shell crab with avocado Their cooked items are delicious too grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles Pair any of these items with some sake or beernnFYI  They take reservations and have a large separate room shoes must be taken off with two tables that can seat 810 ppl each For these tables you sit on the floor and legs can hang below They have set lunch and dinner hours and never pick up the phone unless theyre open and not too busy They open at 530 for dinner and weve arrived at 515 to see a line outsidennHave an urge for some quality and authentic Japanese in Charlotte Look no furtherI have been going here for too many years to count and it is hands down the most authentic Japanese restaurant that exsists here This is not American Style Japanese this is REAL YUMMY JAPANESE FOODI figure Id add to this review too my sister michelle r here on Yelp already wrote a great review and I just wanted to say that I agree with her that this place is really authentic  I come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials  If not the special yes the katsudon is delicious served w rice and onions and an egg on top  So are their bento boxes Ill usually order their grilled mackerel  And yes their sushi is also really good  My only complaint would be that its a little small and it can get too crowded and busy when that happens Ill go to the other Japanese restaurant right around the cornerSome of the most authentic Japanese food Ive eaten in terms of ramen pork cutlets and bento boxs nnThe prices at lunch are definitely reasonable especially for the ramen and the bento boxs but my last visit I indulged in some pork cutlets and miso ramen The cutlets were perfectly cooked having a crispy outer layer from the Panko and a firm but succulent interiornnThe ramen never fails to disappoint and even though I may have gotten the miso ramen this time around the shoyu ramen soy sauce ramen is definitely one of my favorites at MusashiWaiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before It was rather salty instead  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback In any case Im not giving Musashi up yet since its close to home cookingnnMmm at least the ika on the nigiri is thick and the uni on the nigiri is two pieces on one nigiri And I hv lotsa of tuna on my tekkadon Only thing tho the Saba on the nigiri was salty Never had a salty Saba before nnThird cup of green tea YummmThe Pork Ramen is indeed delicious as are the Sushi Gyoza  Shrimp Tempura Handsdown the most authentic Japanese restaurant in South Charlotte Highly recommendedAlright this sushi place reminds me of Mr Miyagi in Houston TXwhich run by a husband n wife teamnnI must eaten here 100th times  or more already but never actually write a review for itnnAgain these private asian restaurants are not known for customer services but I always had great service whenever I ate hereso dine with an open mind and dont expect to be treat like queen or kingnnTheir fishes are always on pointwhen you eat a sushi roll or chirashi bowl it should blend together and give you a satisfying tastennIf you eat sashimi and the restaurant serve you with ice underneath then just leave cuz they dont know what the hell theyre doingnnYes they deserve all 5 stars for their foodsAfter a just okay visit to Yama last week the fella convinced me to try the best sushi in Charlotte at Musashi  Im not a sushi fan but I can eat teriyaki chicken and veggies anywhere  He said he hadnt been in years and was curious to see if they were still as awesome as he remembered  They were  He got 4 or 5 different types of rolls and all were good but he said octopus is one of the best tests of sushi  He said it was a smidgen chewy but its octopus  The teriyaki chicken was good but it came with soup salad and egg salad no grilled veggies like Im used to  It was tasty though  nnOur young waiter was super nice and accommodating this Asian food nerd needed a fork and he even bowed to say thank you when we left  I wouldve never tried this place without the fellas suggestion since its in a strip mall and the sign wasnt even lit when we got there but it was very warm inviting and unassuming with great foodI had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 830pm and were the only souls in the place Let me also say how hard it was to find this place Granted it was raining and dark but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this stripsuite mall I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold rainy night and it sounded very comfortable like memories from college days The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles I dont eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate Overall the ramen tasted good but there could have been much more noodles and less broth This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent Overall this place was just ok I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggiesWe had high expectations because the first time we came here they were pack full and we didnt want to wait for a table so went somewhere else  We came back today and right at the beginning the service was terrible  The older lady looks like she hated life and was rude  The other servers seemed okay but the main one that took care of us was awful  Food was okay  When does it become acceptable to give bad serviceI havent had Japanese food this amazing since high school Amazing absolutely amazing food it felt like I was being welcomed into a homeMy wife and I dont normally go to Japanese restaurants because we dont know too much about them How ever  going to this restaurant was a delightful experience  familyorientated  sushi bar service and full service table dining  staff was very attentive  It was crowded about 90 Japanese so that kind of tells you the quality of food served there  we will go there againThis place is amazing  But if youre looking for hibachi and white sauce this isnt youre place This is authentic and I love it They dont even have white sauce hereMusashi holds a special place in my heart and I cant believe I havent blown up their yelp page with my review This restaurant is familyowned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years Musashi has and will always be my goto place for simple fresh and authentic No sizzing grill no fancy chefs or crazy tricks just the core of Japanese cuisine nnSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday Ive been craving their sashimi for weeks They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more Salmon is my favorite Trust me I kept yearning for a chance to go back If youre more adventurous I recommend the beef tongue If youve never had beef tongue it is soft yet slightly chewy The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth I dont think its on the menu but you can always ask the friendly staff Sadly they ran out on this occasion Weve also tried the Fukahire Salad marinated shark finjelly fish salad grilled sardines and a few other appetizers but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers What can I say were some adventurous eatersnnNow for the main course My absolute favorite is the Katsujyu which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions served over a bed of rice A jyu box is actually the Japaneses traditional method of presenting food how cool If youre not much of a pork fan I would go with the Chickenkatsu If youre in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle roasted pork slices bamboo shoot and green onions Yummm this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp saucennBefore I talk about dessert I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost Im glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture Ready for the end of this food adventure Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect mealThis review is a long time a comin but here it is either way In my first few months I found myself in Charlotte all alone on Yom Kippur which is the jewish holiday where we fast for the entire day thats right an entire day Basically the entire day you dream about what you are going ot eat for dinner which makes it even more excruciating By 8pm 15 hours past sun down I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier she had told me of a secret japanese menu and fresh fishnnWell I can tell you this place has BOTH And the best part is the head chef there and owner is quite japanese and began his career in my home citys Toronto first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s Suffice to say I was pretty sold after talking to this guy nnThe japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot not sure what the name of that is  they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but Ive been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item nnProbably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru yet to try new zealand which i also heard was greatI finally found some legitimate tonkotsu ramen in Charlotte It wasnt bland or watery and the pork chashu was savory and delicious I would definitely come back though it is a little far out from the city 20 min drivennYoull notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home Theres a private dining room which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats sliding doors and pillowsThe owners are also japanese which is always a good sign in my books if youre looking for some lipsmacking ramen nnThe menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan ranging from potato croquettes with the delicious bulldog brand sauce to gyoza and even mini fried crabs Ramen is by far the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths soy miso tonkotsu etcnnThe process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almostcreamy texture of the broth filled with the rich flavor of pork The soup also has a great milkycolor Unfortunately the noodles arent hand made and you can tell theyre more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles However this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl I didnt leave one dropnnThe restaurant serves alcohol but not past a certain hour like 9 or 10 so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki Perfect accompaniment to dinner Prices are very reasonable and the hospitality is fantastic Food is served in a timely fashion and everything tastes phenomenal nnIm already looking forward to the next time I come backnn45It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese Well Musashi is one such place The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone Good authentic menu service and foodThis is the only place to go for Japanese food in Charlotte We are regulars so we are treated very well I dont know what the others complain aboutthe service seems very good to me The food is greatAn adorable family owned restaurant This small Japanese serves a traditional Japanese meal that keeps you coming back for more A must try Arrived party of 6 on a Wednesday night Host would not acknowledge our presence wasted 30 mins of our time figuring out whether we could get a table or notnnTerrible serviceReman was good but the sashimi I ordered was hard do describe  It doesnt look very fresh the cut is not clear and its the first time I know that tuna sashimi can be chewyThis restaurant is nestled in a little shopping center but dont let the locale deceive you The food here is outstanding  I got a musashi bento box probably should have went lighter on the soup and salad I had beforehand with some sort of citrusy wine Everything was excellent  it looks to be a familyowned business as well and it shows with the excellent and courteous service of course the place is usually busy so dont come here expecting fast food but our order arrived within reasonable time Do check this place outIve only been here once but this place impressed me The service was a bit slow but the Lunch Special A I had was very very tasty Well the ramen had somewhat of a weird taste in the soup but the katsu don served over rice wasIve never had better katsu don I would eat it again Most sushi restaurants Ive gone to were owned by Koreans or Americans but I think this place is authentically Japanese including the workers and owner Definitely recommend itIt took a few visits before I felt comfortable with the staff at Musashi  I dont think theyre intentionally unfriendly they just dont go that extra mile Once you get to know them though from waitstaff to sushi chef to kitchen guy  theyre super nice But lets get to the real reason why you should go to this place  the food I think its the most legit Japanese in Charlotte primarily because the place is dominated by Japanese patronsnnAgedashi Tofu  broth is to die for and the tofu so  delicately breadednSea Snails  one again boiledsteamed in sake and the shells put out a delicious broth on their own Texture similar to conchnDumplings  I usually dont love dumplings in Japanese restaurants but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an ordernnSushiSashimi is outstanding  they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonablenSobaUdon  delicious noodles and clear or dark brothhavent tried the cold Soba but thats my next step nnThere is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that nonGaijin menu She said she would be happy to do sonnTo heck with the strip mall atmosphere  this is just a great little gem in South Charlotte for sushi lovers who dont want to dress up like theyre going clubbing dont want disco balls and sake bombs sorry Nikko and EnsoWords cant express how good this place is fo authentic SushinnIt opens at 530 we get there at 515 and theres a line  Everytime Dont let the looks fool youWell here goes my first review to chronicle my lifelong love affair with food I had in mind trying something new because how awfully long some reviews turn out to be  kinda like the length of this introduction So bottomline Im going to begin with a five words or less review nnAuthentic Attentive Explore the appetizersnnThis place fills me with nostalgia The menu selection and execution remind me of my moms dishes and the local mom  pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of JapannnYou wont get a show with your teppan yaki but what you will get is authentic and delicious Japanese food nnIf you are looking to get past the more well known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food Id recommend the agedashi dofu grilled mackerel get a side of rice with it and nabe udon nnAll in all after three times here Ive left with a feeling of happiness  due to some part of not having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market  that hasnt surfaced in quite some time even back home in Long Beach CAnnThe only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen The broth needs some work nn5 starsSimple No sushi in Charlotte at this point beats them Ask for Bunta and the Japanese menu We have been eating there for years Rusan himself eats there We ran into him going in to eat one nightIf you go for lunch I recommend getting either A or B They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out It is such a good deal you only pay about 8 bucks for either box The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi 6 regular rolls 2 larger ones 2 slices of sashimi on rice some kind of mayo based salad miso soup and peanut sauce salad Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup although it can vary many days Both are mouth wateringn     For dinner I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle It is awesome it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful You cannot take this to go so be sure to finish it It has egg and lots of vegetables and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion Other things I enjoy are the pork katsudon ramen curry katsu and the agedashi dofu is excellent Really no matter what you pick you cant go wrong n    On a rare occasion most likely in the winter be sure to check out the sushi specials If they have TORO tunafatty tuna be sure to get it without any questions and do not get the roll just get the whole slab Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth Worth every pennyn    Overall Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place But when the food is that good it doesnt really matter It doesnt have any of the overthetop sushi roll specials but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly cooked rice It is the most authentic Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come acrossToday I had an absolutely horrible experience at Musashi Japanese restaurant on Johnston Road CharlottenWaitress were impolite unfriendly wearing some dirty shoes which should be already a red flag sign but I was hungry and I thought not a big deal Well it turned out to be a big dealnWhere are the traditional appropriate for any type of services smiles Where is the traditional Japanese hospitality you see in other restaurants It was anything like thatn When a hostess found out that I am alone she set me at the small uncomfortable table while the restaurant was nearly empty nI asked to be seated at another table and hostess started arguing I repeat the restaurant was nearly empty and who says if you come alone you dont deserve a better seatnI looked at the menu and asked questions about some dishes but waitresses did not speak English and they could not explain me anythingnI ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI The dish looked very unattractive big chunks of lettuce and  potato salad which I did not order and nobody asked me if I want one on a side the taste was even worse I ate CHICKEN TERIYAKI in many other Japanese restaurants before and this is a delicious dish but not in this terrible placenOn the top of that I saw a bug crawling across the table I killed it and I called a manager Waitress started arguing with me again nI did not see any smiles and I did not hear Im sorry Waitresshostess was rudenI felt sick after that ordealnI could not touch my meal and I left this nasty bugs infested place hungry and frustrated about a horrible experience and my wasted timennI would rate this place the worst ratingMusashi was an overall great experience The restaurant is quaintwarm and cozy I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli fried rice and shrimp sauce The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing The chicken teriyaki was served with soupsalad rice and noodles The most outstanding part was the service They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of I highly recommend itThis place has nice tonkotsu ramen The broth is creamy rich and it looks like they invest a lot of time producing the broth If youre around the area and cant find a nice ramenyasan to go to come here and enjoy a warm bowl of ramenNot exactly sure how this restaurant got so many 5 reviews Without any other restaurants in the area that serve anything japanese besides sushi Its great that they serve ramen and tonkatsu but they were only fair Unfortunately the service suffered too as they are understaffed nnThis place has potential but I will probably not be coming back for a whileWhere should start Parking is abundant in this tiny strip of stores Musashi is from what Ive experienced is an authentic Japanesefamilyrun establishment Having Japanese parents and having lived in Nara for a part of my life I longed for the real Japanese taste in food U can taste it in their Miso soup made with dashi U can taste it in their croquette dipped in tonkatsu sauce Mmmm When I check out a new Japanese restaurant I always go for the chirashi to see what hidden treasure I might discover and boy I think I had MIRUGAI in it I dont think I was dreaming  Back in Japan I missed the chirashi which had unique sashimi pieces like even awabi This natsukashii omoi Arigatoo Musashi I will be back most certainly It is not a fancy restaurant Its portions do not speak in volume but rather in flavor If youve bn to Japanese restaurants run by Chinese you will b able to taste the difference Some people rate by volume value This is rated by aji flavor valueVery authentic Japanese food Highly recommend for anyone looking to experience real Japanese cuisine Not your typical Teriyaki or Hibachi steak kind of place For someone who lived in Japan Musashi will feel just like home And for those who hasnt it will be a rewarding experience Try the ramenProbably the only authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte They have the regular bowls and dishes served in normal every day meal not just sushi Personally I like the tonkatsu ramen and all the bento items Unagi broiled eel here is just okMixed review I was expecting more but left a bit disappointed First of all the directions from Google maps is a bit offit takes you through an apartment complex to a dead end Its located in a shopping center with Food Lion nnThe atmosphere is small with humble interior design There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions nnThe greeting was all smiles The service wasnt fast but not too slow either Our drinks were always full and the server was very friendlynnThe sushi list was limited but priced well The spicy tuna roll was very good Do not order the teriyaki chicken unless you like two marinated chicken breasts with sauce on top served with a cup of rice and a side of lettuce with ginger dressing for 12 Very disappointing The restaurant was fairly busy so Im sure they have better dishes Ill have to go back and try some of the noodle itemsI would say this place was just okay for me Nothing to amazing but the server was nice My husband did not like his sushi very much but I liked my vegetable tempura Our son did not eat most of his bento box and did not like his steak very much either  Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was just not as good a quality as they are used to either way I dont think we will be backIve seen quite a few mixed reviews of Musashi and I can honestly say that you can easily identify the two categories of reviewers those who understand Japanese culture or have been to Japan and everyone elsennIm a bit of a food purist  I feel that if you are going to eat Japanese food than it had better be at a Japanese restaurant with a Japanese chef The same can be applied to other ethnic cuisines I mean if you were on vacation in France would you honestly eat French food in France that is prepared by an American NonnRanting aside Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen Ive had since leaving Japan Period The wifes xc3xa0 la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces  the effort they put in really makes the difference nnIve seen another review here on Yelp and Ill echo it here  you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate  Dont knock them on service without understanding the culture nnIll end the review with this if you think Hibachi is Japanese food then Musashi may not be for you however if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style then look no furtherThe food and atmosphere was quite charming n Had the ramen soup and it was very light and flavorful Highly recommend to try this quaint little placeI am so thankful that this nofrills Japanese place exists I just came back from my first visit for lunch and clearly they know what their doing when it comes to noodles and soups I ordered their porkbased ramen soup with a squid salad Both easily compared to some of the best I used to enjoy back in Philadelphias Asian district This is absolutely my GoTo place in Charlotte for noodles And I cant wait until I get to visit this place againRamen and Gyoza were pretty good Ive had better Green tea ice cream was good as well Need to return to reevaluatethe ramen noodles here would be my first choice Its taste very fresh Costumer service is good The place is very smallIts an OK place for Japanese food and less than OK for sushi nnThe Agedashi tofu was very good lightly fried tofu in a light soy sauce And the cold soba noodles were good I ordered the uni and salmon nigiri and that turned out to be barely OK But what was quite offputting was the 295 cost PER piece of salmon nigiri Id expect its more like 450 to 5 for two pieces So for 295 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good its going to have to be pretty good and unfortunately Id rank it as even less than average Its soft pink nonfatty and flavorless flesh was subpar compared to what Im used to having And Ill say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion Perhaps there are things that are better choices hereWorst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time  I do not understand why this place has any stars at allnnThey were out of basic sushi like tuna etcnThe servers were rudenThree of us were there for dinner on Wednesday they brought out one persons meal then after that person was done eating they brought out the second persons meal and then after that person was done eating they brought out the last meal which was sushi so should not have taken an hournnSo each person had to eat their dinner while the other two watchednnThe sushi menu was stapled scraps of paper that looked like it was made by a kindergartner and was very limited missing even basic items like salmon roll tuna roll eel roll etc  Salmon roe Ikura was dried out so I didnt even eat it and they only gave me a half portion  The Ikura can say a lot about a place it should be wet and firm so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth  If they are sticky deflated oversalted and mushy they are no good and the pace probably isnt either nnMy brother got the pork ramen soup and said it was the worst he has ever eaten the noodles were pasty the broth had WAY too much salt etc  He said it was worse than the packaged stuffnnThe place was also dirty especially the bathroomsnnIt was a horrible experience in almost every way a place can be horrible  There is no chance we will EVER go back  Stay away from this place FAR AWAYFood is really authentic no doubt Service Not too much But I care the food more I dont expect good service in any Asian restaurantThis is THE place to go for sushi in Charlotte The service is barnone Super friendly and informative I eat a lot of sushi and this is my to go list The servers are more than happy to help teach you how to eat your food and what you are gettingnnParking is easyI had a bad experience at Musashi and wont be back I ordered the Sushi Deluxe It comes with 9 nigiri and 6 pieces of tuna roll The sushi took quite a while to come out which I am used to However it was close to room temperature That is a cause for concern with sushi The rice within the sushi was soggy I stopped about half way through the tuna rollWent here because it was very local and I wanted to try some new Jap food NEVER again will I come here again I ordered the teriyaki chicken with miso soup and the chicken tasted like they grilled Tyson chicken and literally just put teriyaki sauce on it Miso soup was ok but overall a very low review as far as the whole meal goes The customer service was great but I will still never order from here again Definitely not the kind of Japanese food I am use to from coming up NorthLove this place Niku dofu dinner only dish is one of our favorite Green bean dessert is yummyWaiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before It was rather salty instead  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback In any case Im not giving Musashi up yet since its close to home cooking nn030317 A Friday DinnernDisappointed It was packed tonight Had to wait about 15 mins for a table Then had to wait 4550 for our food But the waiting wasnt the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile WRONG nnThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right  cut thick n all the same size I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA No MSG No thirst after the meal And the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco nnTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters Hmm I guess Im ole fashion n lived in Japan too long nnI also ordered three uni sashimi Hey Whats with the same price of 350 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi But I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi qualitynnWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG lots n lots nnThe tempura shrimp was perfect not doughy or undercooked nnStill since its near Im not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time nn062417 Party of four n I was the one to suggest Musashi tonight BUT my tekka don came after everyone else finished their dinner Granted its crowded tonite got but still Even the newly arrived ppl sitting next to us got their dinner b4 meAuthentic If youre looking for American sushi go somewhere else Only Authentics need apply herethis place is probably as close to authentic Japanese food as you can get in the south charlotte area its family own for quite a few years now  ive been here for lil over probably 20 times or so and everytime i go i enjoyed my food as usual its freshly cook and sushi is always fresh they use high quality ingredients as well  the place is small with lil less than 15 tables for the whole restaurant it always seems packed  the atmosphere and the decor is also nicely matched the Japanese feel Service is always good server is always smiling and very friendly she made a joke to my friends about how i will finish all the food that they dont eat if they ordered too much lol however the price is not cheap 2 entrees and a appetizer can easily run ur bill up to bout 40  tips and tax ur looking at around 50 at dinner time but u know what u get what u paid for although i cant afford eating here every week but its totally worth it when i do come with friends and family  nnon a side note REAL japanese people eat there ALL the time there is always atleast one table with japanese eating there heyif Japanese are eating japanese food here how bad can it be LOLAmazing Everything was fantastic I want to come back and hope they do a katsu curry special for lunchPlace was good  Small and very authentic which i liked  Very pleased with the placeWith Musashi as with other places I enjoy its all about the food I dont need a greeter with a plastered smile or somebody doting on me every 15 seconds If I have to wait 15 minutes for a table at Musashi thats fine cause I know the food more than makes up for itnnThat said I know this place is hit or miss My sister and I absolutely loved the place as did my Japanese roommates always ALWAYS a good sign that your Japanese roommates love the same Japanese restaurant you do But my brother and sisterinlaw werent too impressed I think Musashi is good solid Japanese food Nothing too fancy What they did they did well Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured Light crisp with a flavorful but not too salty sauce The katsudon is how it should be hot eggy with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice There is also a special Japanese menu with snacks which make great accompaniments to beer and sake or if youre in the mood for tapas I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue Theres also an excellent sukiyaki The lunchtime bento boxes were also very goodnnYou gotta understand When youre living in Charlotte theres not much in the way of Japanese food And when youve been to Japan three or four times you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls Thats where Musashi comes in Theyve got more than just the same standard sushi udon teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US And they dont try to get too fancy nnAnd try to remember its all about the food Not about the lines not the lack of greeting when you enter not the crazy eyed lady who doesnt call you honey Its the foodBest Japanese restaurant Ive found in Charlotte so far Im Japanese and so I can get pretty picky with my Japanese food  I like that there is a Japanese owner and sushi chef and a menu full of authentic dishes None of that Asian fusion stuffVery good very authentic Japanese food  All of the fish was delicious On the back of some menus is a list in Japanese  ask the waiter to translate it for you and order a couple things  these were some of the most delicious items Has seating in more traditional Japanese style and also at tables For alcohol beer or sake are the way to go I cant recall if there was no wine or if the selection was just bad Subtracted one star just because the service was a bit spotty but it was very friendly and the ambiance leaves something to be desiredI have been searching Charlotte for an authentic bowl of Tonkatsu ramen when Musashi popped up on my Urbanspoon app I dragged two friends along with me who felt very uncomfortable and were confused on what to order I ordered everyones food except for the sushi lover who didnt listen to me The food was great and I finished my soup I cant wait to go backFINALLY a place to satiate my ramen needs  Potato croquette  Curry katsu There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene nnYes the previous reviews are spot on authentic Japanese minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls in a super charming space Dont be thrown off by its location next to the Little Caesars with friendly familyrun servicennThis place is packed with fellow Asians not the speedracing kind like Ru Sans which is always a good sign  nnTIP Get the lunch special A or B  Youll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant  The special is 8 and is plenty of food  Last time it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box nnTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences claiming the rolls are similar to the prepackaged ones at the supermarket and unfresh I urge you to try Musashi again I always find the rice perfect and roomtemperature and seasoned well Also to those who complain the sushi menu is small yes its less than a page  However who wants a phonebooksizedmenu if the food isnt good nnIf you want to talk supermarket sushi DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their ownand nobody knows  In fact its pretty good considering nnI also dont think the service is unfriendly at all  Maybe being busy and taskoriented not taking time to chitchat is mistaken for unfriendlinessI duno I just call it efficient nnTIP 2 You cant get their udon or ramen togonnBottom Line  If youre accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA or in cities with large Asian communities no this place isnt going to be on the same level but sometimes you dont need all the frills  Just a solid meal run by a family you can tell knows what theyre doingI used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic tastennWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrongnnThe lady wasnt so friendly but I dont mind she was like that all the time We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I dont remember a tempura udon and a chicken katsu nnI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making There was no delicacy I was surprised when he handed me the dish I obviously wasnt happy to see the result The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri or rice ballnnThen my chicken katsu and my moms udon came out The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting nothing more nor nothing less Rice chicken salad additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad and miso soup It was good Just normal chicken katsu Not so crispy this time The portion is pretty big My mom liked the udon The broth was clear and light color the tempuras came out on a separate plate Tempuras were just ok nnThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine I dont know if Ill comeback when Im in town again Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food But definitely no sushi at Musashi I just want to say that just because its owned by Japanese dont automatically assume that itll be goodThis is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending 2000 for airfare The food is awesome The people are awesome The place rocksnnTo all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressingthis is an authentic Japanese restaurant Not the American Hibachi down the street Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no boundsTACO BELLnnThe service is always perfect I love the staff there They let me practice my Japanese and are always excited when I get it right To the people saying the service is slow The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin Its JapanesennAgain hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small foodbar in the country This is NOT American style Japanese its AUTHENTICnnxe5x84xaaxe7xa7x80xe9xa3x9fxe5x93x81xefxbcx81Truly authentic Japanese food The staff is always friendly and welcoming Their ramen and udon are both very solid The bento boxes give you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious My personal favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai I have been known to order them for dessert while the wife prefers the green tea ice cream If you crave Japanese go check them out you will not be disappointedAuthentic and best ramen in Charlotte Dining area is small but the lunch specials are inexpensive and deliciousMy family has been loyally going here about 12 times a week for about 10 years The most authentic familystyle run Japanese restaurant youxc2xb4ll findIts been a few years since Ive come here but I know it has good sushi so I invited 5 friends  We tried the pork ramen and udon soups for the first time  They were ok but lacking the flavor I was expecting as if the broth was made some time ago and then the ingredients thrown in that day We all got softshell crab rolls and liked them  My Hornet Roll was very good and the tuna and yellowtail rolls were also very good  The staff is super nice and the quaint little paper room was great to have our group  We will be back for more sushiNice lunch specials one with warm items and one with sushinnSushi chef and waitresses speaking Japanese with customersnnFree wifi from neighboring businessesIve heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out Here are my reviewsnnVenue  the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan If you have a large group of people your group will be sitting as if youre sitting on a floor but your not The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open Its a comfortable sitting arrangementnnSushi  the Unagi Eel was cooked perfectly The softcrab shells are not bad but I had better ones before  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy They need better selections in sushinnPresentation  the restaurant lacks in presentation  It was a very simple dish put together  nnSake  they are pricey 1500 minimum nnRamen  the soup was very tasty  nnOverall  if you are craving for ramen this is the best place so far Ive tasted As for sushi I would only come here once Ive had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California Also if you dont tip enough You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip Its a MANDATORY  It feels like a teacher is about to scold youAfter failing at Mr Tokyo I chose another Japanese place I wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner Musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take  a min of 40min My parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box I ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that I couldnt order half the menu Never eating Japanese in Charlotte ever againUpfront disclosuresnI am a sushi snob and am extremely particular about my sushinnI am going to break my review into two parts  Typical Japanese food and sushi  nnTypical Japanese food We ordered some pork shumai that were pretty good but was served with a brownwasabitype paste  It tasted like wasabi but why the hell was it brown We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi  The kimchi was very spicy but good  The pork was a bit tough  nnThey have a whole list of special appetizers but only about 4 were translated into english  My girlfriend asked for more translation but the waiter told us we really wouldnt be interested in them so we dropped the conversation on it nnMy gut tells me this place has very good and very authentic Japanese food but I am not experienced enough in nonsushi Japanese food  nnOn to the sushi  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place  nnMusashi has a very small sushi menu  There are few rolls to choose from and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri  nnWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri  The fish was cut rather sloppily and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon  The salmon was all pink no typical whitefat lines  whynnThe rolls come in pieces of 3 which I find weird  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up as the rice was cold and solid  not like sushi rolled right in front of you nnWe have not been back  If youre looking for really really really authentic Japanese food I would head here and try  if youre looking for a great sushi experience I would try other places in the areaThis place was incredible Everything I tried I loved I highly recommend the pork ramen I could eat that everydayThe reason Im giving Musashi a 4star review is because I love their ramen noodles as well as their appetizers  They taste amazingnnHowever the sushi is down right awful  Its cold and tasteless kind of like supermarket sushi  After eating sushi at Musashi twice I gave up  So the only reason I go back is to have their amazing appetizers and ramen noodlesnnThe service is quite cold and unfriendly  I am not the type to want any chitchat between customer and server but the ladies there are quite cold unresponsive and slow  I prefer efficient service no chit chat no upselling  They tend to ignore you which is fine until you want to leave and they still ignore youJust an update still great food Prices have scooted up over the past couple of years Lunch box is 10 something now and Nabeyaki udon is 15Best sushi in town Apparently they are the most authentic japanese restaurant in Charlotte having hired one of the best sushi chefs Im not sure if thats true but the sushi is amazing If you go during lunch they have a special for 850 and is more than enough food to eat nnMy only complaint is that they dont have fountain sodas  so if you order youre getting a can But this doesnt stop me from giving this place 5 stars bc of the food is that goodSeriously this place is a diamond in the rough nnOkay so we were taken here when we visited before we moved by friends who lived in Japan for 30 years It is legit Japaneseowned familystyle restaurant and their food is both beautiful aesthetically and amazing tastes Can I say UMAMI Umm if you even slightly know anything about Japanese food go here You will not be disappointed Both their sushi and dishes are delicious nnYes it is true that the language can be a barrier if you try to edit things but there is a younger guy who works there that is helpful and speaks perfect english I personally am learning Japanese but I just go with the flownnOn the downside trying to call during hours in between openings ie 25pm is to no avail and so reservations highly recommended are harder to make ahead of time I would suggest calling when they are open towards the evening nnAnyway try itIf you are looking for the best Japanese Restaurant in Charlotte this will be the best one It is owned by a Japanese family it has most authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte They have all the traditional dishes and sushi It is always great to get lunch there they always have special and it always price right The restaurant gave you a feeling that you are in Japan you will see Japanese business man drinking and order a lot of small dishes I love this restaurantnnEnvironment 10 out 10nService 8 out of 10nFood Quality 9 out of 10I have always had a really good experience here  It is never too crowded and the service is always excellent  They are open on Mondays when most places with ramen arent  The service is quick and friendlynnI love the ramen  Its always delicious  It is very consistent  I always get the steamed dumplings as well and love them too  The broth for the ramen is so flavorful its like you just cant get enough  nnParking is easy with a large shared lot  The restaurant inside is clean cozy and comfortable  Always very happy with my visits hereA cute little place And really yummy authentic Japanese foodnnIts hard to find an authentic Asian cuisine around Charlotte there are many good sushi and hibachi places but theres always a little something that makes the restaurant a bit more of a Asian American fusion Musashi is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte because it is one of the most authentic restaurants both in the interior and the food and the servers are attentive I frequent this restaurant on a weeklybiweekly basis Delicious worth the drive from Huntersville  Best Sushi Ive had in a while The Shuman dumplings were perfect Very traditional Japanese   Red bean ice cream for desert pleasant surpriseGreat place Ive been in north Carolina for 3 years now and Ive seen this place and was always scared to go in due to it looking small Well  the hell with the outside Best Japanese food 8 charlotte and authenticIf you are looking for the most authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area this is your place While it is in a strip mall once we walked in we were greeted with smiles and told to sit anywhere The first thoughts we had were of Japan while looking at the decor Our server was very attentive and helpful Absolutely no complaint about service herenn We have been here twice The first time we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer The gyoza were perfect  served with a chile oil and soy sauce The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms half an egg three pieces of pork that were very tender a piece of fish cake and noodles with a lovely chewy texture The broth tasted of every one of those things  a warm inviting flavor nnThe second visit I got the tonkatsu ramen again while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box Her box came with a whole tonkatsu 4pc California roll 2 shrimp tempora 4 pc vegetable tempora a seaweed salad miso soup a small salad a shrimp dumpling a pork dumpling and an egg roll Needless to say we had enough food for lunch the next day Those two meals plus sweetened tea for two came to almost 4200 For the atmosphere the friendly service and the authentic food I cant wait to go back and try the river eel over rice Please dont pass this one byAuthentic Japanese items on the menu that you dont see at other Japanese restaurants My favorites items have to be the ramen Its way better ramen than futobuta in South End We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and watching the sushi chef create beautiful dishes The place is really popular and event a wait at 630pm on a FridayIve been here twice Each time ive gotten ramen I must say theyre consistant The ramen is delicious and fresh nnService was great staff friendly Place is small expect to be seated near people you dont knownnI look forward to trying the sushi but until then I have nothing bad to sayWent for dinner  excellent tonkotsu ramen noodles  the broth was delicious Also has potato croquets  five stars Service was excellent as well This place is authentic the service is perfect  my favorite drink cones to the table before I ask they know all their customers nKeep up the great work nOh great sushi by the waySuper authentic casual Japanese restaurant  Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits but the more rarefied fish both grilled and rare are what attract me  nnThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar  They take some time to warm up but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes but I suppose thats unsurprisingnnMusashi is very casual and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus powdered wasabi and pink ginger   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish  Heres a rundown on what I hadnn Sashimi platter  I ordered a la cart a large sampling but you can do one piece each so everythings very small portion wise   As I saidauthenticn Anago  delicious butteryn ika  squid was a highlight very light and with a touch of crunchn surf clam  also delicious I was feeling their bivalves   They cater to the Japanese paletten tako  fresh and delicately flavorful  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  n ebi  slightly more flavorful than usualn saba  marinated and tastyn hamachi sake hirame maguro  fairly standard although the salmon was better than expectedn ikura  I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature  nnI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi however the selection and relative freshness were both very good  They didnt have any special fish such as toro  they said that specials come in during the weekends   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently  nn hamachi Kama  very fresh not previously frozen cooked with some interesting spices n mackerel  grilled and salted to perfection  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty juicy interior with a crisp skinn sanma  a little bit of a pain to eat since I dont do the guts however some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fishTried this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend  We had the vegetable tempura tonkotsu ramen and chicken katsu cutlet  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menunnProsnn The food here is authentic  I am not Japanese but this restaurants dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting OsakaTokyo  As far as I know this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soupsnIt seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise nService was good and food came out very quickly  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizernPrice is reasonable perhaps a touch highnnnConsnnnThe restaurant space is cramped  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangementfloorplannThe restrooms are single person restrooms  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky presumably from spilled fooddrinknThe portion sizes are not consistent  The tempura appetizernotably no onion rings was about 78 small vegetables which I consider to be small  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides  My ramen was just the right size</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","

weekend  We had driven by a couple of times and had it pointed out during the Haunted Vegas tour a couple years agonnPutting it simply the food was incredible  Being from NY I am an Italian food snob and this was some of the best I have ever had  I had the veal scallopini my wife had the chicken marsala and we were in heaven  Then we had the canolis for dessertnnThe service was fantastic as well  The place was pretty busy but service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was a lot of fun  This is definitely a place we will visit again next time we are in Vegasi had the best Chicken Marcela ever The spaghetti with meet sauce was nothing to rave about Prices are greatBasically the best Italian in town for the price  The service is USUALLY excellent  Food is consistently good  The atmosphere is Liberace cheesy but its part of the charmMmmmm delicious food and a little history Mr Liberace himself designed the interior of his restaurant and they have not changed it since his passing no this is not a bad thing The cheese manicotti in marinara sauce was absolutely delish just like home cooking should be The spumoni ice cream is home made by the way not store bought And if you happen to have a free moment you can breeze by the Liberace museum and check out his eye catching performance wearThis is old Vegas this atmosphere is old school but cool make sure to check out the Liberace bar too The food was good not great but really good food the lasagna was very tasty and the house dressing was very uniquen told the staff we had a show to get to in 45 mins and they got us in and out in plenty of time on a Saturday night nice worknits a must at least once given its historyHeavy on the atmosphere heavy on the red sauce light on the wallet  No the food here isnt great  But its good and I always make time to come here every time I come to Vegas  Its worth it just to see the piano bar  Recommendations chicken parm not veal for some reason meatballs gnocchi  Also they have a private dining room in which Ive had several successful events and make for a nice break from the typical trade show stuff  and definitely gets people to remember youThis place is fun I gave it an extra star because its next to the Liberace museum Any place located to close to Liberace MUST be fantastic right Right I guess In any case the food was just okay but the portions were pretty ginormous and the price was right The joint is off strip which was a nice change becuase its relatively peaceful there and the diners all seemed to be locals except us And trust we did stand out The ambiance is fun with differently themed and decorated rooms depending on your occasion and the bar there is dark as any other in Sin City but slightly divier Service was good albeit a little slow and all in all the meal was a success A little wine never hurt anyoneNOT CLOSEDnMoved to new addressnn9821 S Eastern AvenLas Vegas  NV 89183n7024315485nnExcellent food and serviceI like this place solely on its atmosphere  Its awesome  The food good but no frills  Its straight up  The portions are huge and service has always been greatThis is actually a 35 star review and Im giving Carluccios a bonus by rounding to 4 nnEmbarrassing that having lived in Vegas I had no idea Carluccios existed Some friends from Phoenix came down and wanted to meet at Carluccios for a group dinner When I arrived at the parking lot I was in awe This place was ostentatious and gorgeousjust the way I like it I felt like I was in on an old Vegas secret and someone was going to hand me a briefcase full of cash for me to do something illegal with Carluccios is right next to the Liberace museum something I need to go see and apparently Liberace designed the interior The interior was gold all over hanging lights dark lighting dark carpetsI loved it This is a great place to have a small dinnerfamily gathering nnNow for the foodservice Service was average My water glass was always full the waiter took our order fast and the service was pleasant Unfortunately the waiter we had made me nervous I asked if the Caesar salad was vegetarian and he said yes Then I confirmed if it had anchovies as many authentic Ceasars do and he said Oh yeahit does But he was quick to tell me the other dressings that would suit me The food also took forever to come out I ordered a mixed green salad with thousand island side salad and an eggplant parmigiana The mixed green came with about a gallon of thousand island on it rendering it inedible I like my dressing but I also like to see my salad Perhaps I should have ordered dressing on the side but I did not expect that much The eggplant parmigiana served with spaghetti with marinara was very good Fried to the right extent and with a gorgeous piece of melted mozzarella on top and drowned in tasty marinara this was comfort food that hit all the right stops nnEveryone else on the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals The portion sizes were huge I mean I could have eaten my parmigiana for about 4 meals No exaggeration here I later realized that they do have half orders for some of the menu So ask about that if youre a light eater The meal was also priced very very reasonably My parmigiana was 1299 and my husbands spaghetti with marinara was 899 nnThe dinner also came with a magician who entertained us for a little bit The guy was pretty good at what he did card tricks disappearing money that appears somewhere incredible later and added to a fun night nnHighly recommend this place for a unique group eventdinner Im definitely coming when my girlfriends make a trip here I know theyd appreciate the decor overthetop and dark Id like to mention here that some girls at the group ordered cocktails that were apparently awful The waiter did take the cocktails back Maybe you might want to stick to wine with your mealThis is my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas I am here a few times a year visiting family and whenever I am this is always on my list of places to go  The staff has always been friendly and the food has never disappointed me  The bread is really good tooI guess I need someone to tell me just what is good here foodwise perhaps next time I should check out the Yelp reviews first But the ambiance is totally awesome So it evens out to 3 starsnnI finally got around to eating here last weekend as part of my date night We hadnt read anything about it and thus had no idea what to expect As soon as we walked in we were in love This place perfectly represents that image of old Vegas I have in my head It was outlandish while also warm and welcoming I could just picture Liberace eating here I could also imagine the Rat Pack mobsters etc eating here as it just seemed so fitting of all of themnnWe started off our dining experience with the calamari Unfortunately it wasnt even edible We had little doubt that it came straight out of a box from the frozen food aisle 1 star For entrees I opted for the cavatelli it had an icon indicating it as one of their signature dishes and my husband had the gnocchi The menu described the cavatelli as sauteed and with meat sauce What I was served was neither sauteed nor meat sauce I almost asked if I was served the wrong thing but since our server was the wife of the owner I felt bad saying anything The pasta was too mushy the sauce wasnt very good at all and I barely tasted any cheese My date declared it inedible I nibbled at it a bit but refused a take home box 1 star My dates gnocchi was ok but also not cooked properly 2 stars And 1 star too for the wine listnnAt the end of our meal our server explained the history of the restaurant and gave us the lay of the land so to speak It was great to walk around and see all the different rooms love the bar area and all of the pictures especially the ghost pictures The place itself is most definitely 5 stars And that fact alone will bring us back here and have us recommending it to visitorsWe asked our hotel concierge for a restaurant recommendation  She said theres a place off the strip where you can get excellent cheap Italian food  She said Im Italian and I love it and all my out of town guests always ask to go there  So we said what the heck beats paying a fortune for a mediocre meal at one of the big fancy hotel restaurants  nnThe first note about Carluccios is it is right next door to the Liberace Museum  Las Vegas is such a bizarre place  Any way the interior is a flash back to to the 80s and still kind of charming in that bizarre Las Vegas sort of way  It was also dark inside which was a good thing because they would get negative stars for the cleanliness factor  Our bread basket and the inside of my menu had globs of marinara sauce on them  Tastyum nodisgustingnnThe bread was outstanding  It was just bread with no fancy dipping oil or vinegar Just good solid bread with butter  Side saladblech  Bottle of Pinot Grigioyummy friend pointed out it could be bought at Costco for half the price we paid  Mushroom appetizergood in conceptmushrooms in white wine sauce topped with cheese and baked  Not so good in execution as the wine sauce was tangy and harsh  Chicken parmigiana entree pretty tasty  It was served with a side of pasta with meat sauce containing very little meat to speak of  I tried my friends gnocchi and it was doughy tasting not in a good way  We skipped dessertnnService was poor but what do you expect when  you can get a bottle of wine 3 entrees 3 side salads and an appetizer for less than 80 the wine was half the bill at 40  nnThis place would be great for a group of people who want decent food for cheap  Plus Liberace is next door  Thats a big draw right there  Or notI have driven by  Carluccios many times over the past 20 yrs and always wanted to try it but never got around to it It always seemed to have an old school vibe which I like Picked up my uncle for an early dinner and he suggested  Carluccios he said it was very good Works for me Really cool decor very nice and attentive staff I had the ceasar salad which was cold and dressed perfectly I think the crutons may have been homemade Moved onto the meat stuffed ravioli which was great The portions are large as one expects at Italian and Mexican restaurants Had to take half home and eat the next day When you walk into the door the smell of garlic hits you which is a good sign I thought it was priced right 9 and up I will be backI didnt realize this place shutdown I used to love this place came here so many times when I lived in Vegas It was really good Italian food and pretty cheap compared to Sergios Italian Gardens a few doors down And I guess the whole Liberace museum is gone too the last of Liberace PlazaGreat prices romantic ambience delicious Italian basics  nnIf you are looking for a tasty meal but dont want to spend a fortune and its very easy to do that in Vegas Strip restaurants this is a great place just a few minutes East of the strip on Tropicana  nnIts very popular and a lot of locals eat there we saw cast members from one of the shows and the interior is whimsically designed by Liberace  mirrors strings of white lights dangling from everything Italian fountains  The recorded music features showtunes and jazz standards sung by greats such as Frank Sinatra Bobby Darin and even Rod Stewart but I believe they have live music as well maybe during happy hour  Its dark in the dining area but the thousands of string lights and candles on the table create a nice romantic glow  nnThe food was very yummy and very inexpensive for how good it was  I had the Cavatelli pasta a curved tubular pasta  a little like Penne with a break in it with Marinara and CLEANED my plate  My husband had spaghetti with meat sauce and mushrooms and he liked his a lot as well  We shared fried calamari with marinara  The pasta dishes were 9 each and my husband took most of his home  nnWe love Italian food and for the price this is one of the best in Vegas  We barely spent 30 for the both of us which is great because we went to an Italian restaurant in a hotel restaurant on the Strip and spent 50 per person  I wish we had gone to Carluccios for Valentines Day because the ambience is romantic yet fun  It is nothing fancy but they do basics very well  I would like to go back to try their fish dishes other entrees are priced between 12 and 20  nnLike Italian food  Then you MUST try CarlucciosWe had a 50 anniverasy here for my grandparents They accomdated us very well We had a private room with all our close family and friends We were able to drop the  cake off early and they stored it for us Wine was on the tables and food was delish We had a couple options to choose from It was perfect for my grandparents as they are fans when coming to Las Vegas from californiaIts my familys favorite place  They have been taking me there for years  Its a pretty simple joint  Not a big wine list  Not pretentious  Really fantastic red sauce  I eat the Shrimp Fra Diavolo with the hot marinara  The veal dishes are really good and what you would expect Italian to be  Other places get fancy Carluccios gets it right  Best of all they have been around for as long as Ive been around  Nothing has changed  Every taste is like it was many many years agoI LOVE THIS PLACE  The first time we ate there it was 21 years agoI  go there for the chicken livers with a tarragon cream sauce served over a bed of linguine  YUMMMY  Hosted a dinner party two years in a row for 40 people and the bill was reasonable Fun place to gonot fancy datedbut the food is good  The lasagne was yummy tooand hrmmm what else did I steal off someones platestuffed mushroomsand hrmm scampi  LIFE IS GOODCant say much more than what everyone else has already said  as far as old school Vegas Italian food places go this is my favorite spot in town  How can you go wrong with good solid food and a Liberace designed interior nnCalories be damned this time I went for the Shrimp Alfredo  which was absolutely stellar  Wide ribbon noodles in a decadent thick alfredo sauce that was seriously one of the best Ive ever had  The portions are HUGE  so I have leftovers for lunch today  My husband had the Shrimp Oreganado which looked fabulous with a side of spaghetti  he liked it so much he polished it off  He may as well have licked the plate nnIf you go  dont forget to take a peek in the piano lounge supposedly the most haunted room in Vegas according to the magician performing there   A charming room with twinkle lights in the ceiling a pianoshaped bar classic white Eero Saarinen Tulip chairs and a fabulous mirrored piano a la Liberace  Thursday happy hour has live music too  Prices are reasonable  our party of four got out for half of what we paid a month ago at Casa Di Amore down the streetnnCant wait to go back  as Liberaces theme song would sayIll Be Seeing YoudefinitelyWhen I heard the Liberace Museum was shutting down was wondering if theyd still be open  Im happy to report they are  And they remain one of my favorite places in Vegas and a tribute to red sauce  The chicken parm was as good as ever and the service was excellent  And you cant beat the interior design  I love this placeThis is a wonderful hidden treasure  Ive driven by there a thousand times and even went to the Liberace museum when it was still open  However I didnt think to try the restaurant until my mom bought a dining deal  I went with my parents and had this old school throw back Italian meal  My mom had the lasagna a la carte  Huge piece came out  I doubt you could eat much more than that portion  She took half of it to go  My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish I cant remember the name of it  I tried a couple bites and it was very good  I had this shrimp and garlic dish cant remember the specific name of it either but it was very good  In fact I took a piece of bread and mopped up the rest of the sauce  Every meal comes with a side of spaghetti and marinara  I was too full to eat it but my dad said it was very good  nnA couple weeks later my husband and I went for their Thursday night happy hour  Its so wonderful to go into the bar area  If you like anything that sparkles youll love this place  The bar is a white piano and sparkles from the ceiling to the floor  They also have live music on Thursday nights  Not sure if they have different acts but the night we were there the people were very talentednnMinimum my husband and I will be back for their happy hour  Im sure well make it for dinner tooComfortable  quiet  I feel nurtured in this joint  I eat in the bar so I can feel close to the piano weird I know  I dont go for the food but it is enjoyable  The chicken marsala has an eclectic sweet taste which is refreshingnnPS  Dont call old Vegas tacky its Fabulous Las Vegas not 7 shades of Beige Las VegasnRIP LiberaceThe Olive Garden by any other name is still The Olive GardennnGo to Noras on Flamingosimilar prices radically better wine list and many many times better overallIve been always wanting to try Carluccios  Im an often Vegas tourist who likes to explore nookandcranny museums eateries et al I know life is more than the Strip  I have the opportunity to finally get there over July 4th weekend  All you need to know is that I did so in 111 degrees and via bus  and it was oh so well worth itnnFirst the service and staff were wonderful  Id been seated maybe 5 minutes and looking at the menu when another server or manager insisted on making sure I got some water because I looked like Id been out in the sun  For an older restaurant the service was anything but attitudewise  very enthusiastic friendly knowledgeablevery homeynnFoodwise wow for the choices and taste and also for the reasonable prices  I had the stuffed shrimp which came witha side of pasta I wanted to try the sauce plus I ordered a side of meatballs along with a  casesars salad  For dessert I had to try  or shall I say ingest  a homemade cannoli   All food items were exceptionally tasteful authentic unique flavorfuland the homemade bread was yummy as well  Plus I did check out the lounge area for all the celb pics and piano bar and all the historical things thanks to other reviewers for suggestingnnJust an allaround great dinning experience after a scorching hot day of playing tourist  Totally hit the spotnnPS  As i understand it the Trop location is closing Liberace closing wasnt good with the restaurant tucked back in the shopping center and a smaller version will be opening in Henderson  If I get to Henderson ona future trip you can be sure I will be there for dinnerBe forewarned they are very heavy in their sauces and you can order light sauce This would have been helpful to us if we had known before hand nnWith that being said this place was a disappointment  Its Italian food with upscale pricing but low scale food quality Ive never been to an Italian restaurant where they serve prepackaged butter with their bread sticks The food was covered in their sauce and it looks like you received a bowl of sauce They do serve a lot of food and we were like every table there taking food home in a container nnThe ambiance was very dark and loud Dress ranged from formal to tshirt casual The staff was very friendly though nnIn the end I dont think Id make another visit here on my next Vegas tripSometimes when I go to an older place like this I have to decide if it is a run down dump or if it authentic and charming  Carluccios has the old school charmnnThe place is by the now derelict Liberace Museum on east Tropicana  I am guessing it has been here for 2030 years which is a long time by Vegas standards so it has some history  The place has brick walls old school burgandy colored booths custom wood door dark wood in the bar area and I loved the black and red tiles in the bathroom  nnIt has a bar area restaurant area and we sat in the atrium area at a table  The hostess and waitress were very friendly  nnThe menu was typical of a Italian joint  The prices seemed reasonable  I ordered the meatballs and sausage plate  It was a large offering with a side of pasta  Very tasty  the meat sauce was right on  I tried a friends chicken parm  that was tasty  Huge servings at reasonable prices  nnCarlucios is so not corporate and thats why I really like itOMG I cant say enough about this place Was in town heard about this place so we decided to try it out We heard about if from the man who does the Vegas ghost tours There was nine of us and we ALL LOVED the place We LOVED it soooo much we went back the next night   John the owner was so nice he told of all about the ghost stories John and his staff are so nice They have a magican that comes around the table He was really good  sorry cant remember your name   The food was so good and they give you so much The pasta primavera was the best I ever had The bartender is the best I will be back everytime I go to Vegas If i could give it more stars I would John  your crew and you are FANTASTIC keep up the good workBest service I have had in a long time  He cared and made sure everyone was having a good time and meant itFood was excellent for the price 912 for all meals and the place is all lit upYou need to go here if you want to get off the stripIt is a good experience inside as well as outside with the neon pianoA late sixties year old woman struggled to light a cigarette sitting on a bench below the Carluccios Tivoli Gardens neon sign high above her  I hate having to come out side to smoke she mumbled pulling her light sweater over her shoulders   Our party bus pulled into the parking lot and drove past the Liberace Museum and neon grand piano and stopped in front of the smoking Carluccios regular  We all streamed out of the bus as she reviewed and evaluated each one of us I bet most of these kids dont even know who Liberace was she mused  I opened the wood carved door to the Liberace design restaurant and the team entered into a world hip and cool 35 years ago that is now hip and cheeky in 2007nnI travel to Las Vegas at least two times a year for various trade shows for eBay or for various social events  Like many of my friends I get tired of the big casino hotspots that we all read about in the hotel room Las Vegas magazines   Thankfully my friend Jennifer found Carluccios through her parents that live in the area and decided to host our team party there  Carluccios was probably THE place to be for Las Vegas hip in the 70s and is now a refreshing escape for those of us looking for something differentyet sill Las VegasnnApparently Carluccios was designed by Liberace and it shows Each room is a different style from a dark lounge with vinyl booths to an Italian sculpture garden to the allmirrored back room replete with a bar shaped like a piano and twinkling lights on the ceiling  Our group from eBay found our way to the mirrored back room where we enjoyed hearty Italian food Bottles of Chianti housed in the traditional whicker baskets greeted us and were free flowing accompanied by mozzarella and tomato and fried calamari hors doeuvres  Due to our group 21 size Carluccis served a fixed menu including veal parmesan chicken picatta and Lasagna  The food was great for the basic Italian fare and the portions are HUGE  Most of the group only ate half of what was served  Id recommend even ordering one entre and splitting it I had the veal which was a little tough and smothered in sauce and cheese  That should tell connoisseurs of Italian food that its not topline quality  However  Henry had the chicken parmesan which he said was good and Beth had the lasagna which she seemed to enjoynnWe were entertained by a great piano bar duet Gus and Kathy  Gus is a stage name for CJ who is a full time plumber in Las Vegas  Kathy is a long time friend of 30 years who sings with Gus in his OffThe Strip appearances Gus with is long gray pony tail and grey bushy mustache tickled out basic Sinatra tunes and 70s hits like Easy Like Sunday Morning Kathy chimedin with dowaps and chorus versus when appropriate  My friend Beth requested for me Staying Alive by the Bee Gees hoping to elicit a performance reminiscent of Marty and Elaine from Swingers  However Gus did not have that song on his laptop that sat on top of his piano serving as his sheet music Beth was able to get More Than A Woman played for those of us with a Barry Gibb cravingnnAfter Gus and Kathys final number we cleared out of the back room shaking hands with the musical duo and thanking Carluccis manager for a great experience  Overall the food was goodnot great  However the AMBIANCE and the oldschool Las Vegas experience is OFF THE CHARTS  I HIGHLY recommend taking the 10 cab ride off the strip to experience this restaurant  I get the feeling most frequent Vegas travelers are not aware of this hidden vinyl and polyester gemThis was one of the most wonderful places to go tonEspecially for birthdaysnEverything tasted like wine the food was beyond greatnThe stuffed mushrooms ruled the earthnThe seafood diablo was the shitnThe chocolate mouse tasted like a shot of boozennI loved the atmosphere and the classiness The twinkly white lights it was so Liberace chic nEvery room was beautiful and so was the bar This was one of the last great las Vegas gems to fade outnnEvery time I drive by I get sadnI was 16 when i had my nice birthday dinner there nI wish this place would just come backCarluccios is the king of Italian restaurants in Vegas For the price for quality and quantity it doesnt get any better Service is great and the location is right off the strip All you new comers and old timers in town need to make this your Italian go toThis is my favorite Italian place in Vegas It has great local history being that as Tivoli Garden it was owned by the one and only Liberace It has one of his pianos in the back seating area and the back bar is grand piano shaped The food is really really good and the atmosphere hearkens back to the good old days of Vegas when the Rat Pack and the Mob were headliners I have gone here for the 13 years I have lived her and consider it a must show to visitors who think the Strip is Vegas We know betterTHIS is Vegas BABYIf you want great Italian food that will not break the bank This is the place to go This place has been there since the early 1980s and you can tell by the decor They have their fair share of loyal customers including myself nnThe food there is awesome The seafood diablo is a must have so is the orange roughy in white sauce If you like shrimp the crab stuffed shrimp is great as an appetizer or as an entree The zuppa the clams is also a great appetizer nnI know service is a hit or miss This is the same with all restaurants However I still give it 5 stars for great food that is not over priced No one can beat this placeThis restaurant just moved to Silverado Ranch Blvd  and Eastern Avenue The address is 9821 South Eastern Ave Why would I tell you that because without a doubt this is my favorite Italian Restaurant The sauces are all authentic and old school Italian nI have tried so many items lasagna raviolis cheese and meat Zuppa de Clamson and on I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered The homemade bread is amazing My husband loves the chicken parmigiana and it is the most tender chicken I have ever tasted You can tell they tenderize it properly in the kitchennThis restaurant has an incredible staff everyone is wonderful The food the staff make it worth the drive nSo look for the Doc Hollidays behind Freeds Bakery and you will find the new location for the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas  I just wish I could get the recipe for the sauceabsolutely perfect nThe desserts are excellent too If I have an opportunity to go out to dinner this is where I go See you thereIve been to Carluccios several times the last being on January 24 2011  Unlike prior experiences I was less than satisfied  The Casaer Salads were watery and when complained and asked that they be replaced we got more of the same  I had Spaghetti  meatballs as my entree  The meatballs and sauce were bland and there was probably a quarter of a cup of pasta water in my plate  I didnt bother complaining  I think they lost a customerBeing a 2nd generation Sicilian and growing up eating true homade italian cuisine you can expect me to be extremely picky when it comes to italian food  One of the great things I love about vegas is if good dego eats is what you crave chances are youve got a top notch joint with in 5 minutes away from you at any given time and carluccios is one of the best  For an old school vegas feel great service and phenominal food look no further  Whenever I go I get linguini with muscles clams shrimp and calamari  I cant tell you the exact name of the dish but it comes in red spicy arabiata style sauce and it is to die for  nnWith its central location just minutes from the strip this place is perfect for locals and tourist a like  If your visiting do yourself a favor forget about the overpriced strip hotel restraunts And pay carluccios a visit you wont be disapointedGreat ambiance  Real old school Vegas feel to it  Food was good but not great  The chicken marsala had a different taste to the sauce  A bit of a mapley flavor to it  Portions are not very big  Still its a decent place to eat for Italian and I will be backalright soheres the deal if youre looking for something a bit different experience wise thats not super vegas strip typical fare this is definitely the place to visit the experience a visual buffet the food averagennthe food is moderately good ive had way worse but its not amazing the red sauce is somewhat bland and slightly tangy which is definitely not my stylennthe portion size was huge we had the veal florentine and chicken parmesan the veal was so super tender and moist the chicken was alright nnwas it worth it just for the strange Liberace ambiance and casual no frills attitude absolutely it looks like this was the place where all the mobsters would eat flashing bulbs on the ceilings and brown brick walls with yellow windows everyone in the place was having a great time laughing it up getting loud and boisterous which is a good signnni admit it the next morning i wished i hadnt wasted a vegas meal on this place but ill surely never forget it i think the lights have been burned into my memory foreverService kinda sucked so did the food Its a meal though and if someone else is paying why complain I wouldnt go there again thoughI cant enough about this place as where to go to show out of town guests a piece of classic Las Vegas nnAnyplace named I Lov it spelled backward by Liberace is worth a try especially if you remember his shows nnWe went as a group and sat in the piano bar room The owner was happy to show us all of the great Liberace memorabilia and where when the place was owned by Liberace he liked to sit nnOur food was fantastic I had the chicken livers tarragon This was the recommendation of our server for something unique from their menu It was fantastic tremendously filling with lots of garlic butter good wine and perfectly prepared tender livers If you are a fan of liver I know it is not everyones favorite this is the meal for you nnKelly our bartender knows all of the classic cocktails and talked us into trying an Italian margarita She also can make the champagne drinks Liberace loved so much This is a great place for a good classic cocktail nnThe restaurant is not your typical pub for Las Vegas No video poker machines no blaring televisions you go here and talk to the rest of your party Compared to the strip food the portions are generous and reasonably priced nnFamilies are welcome and seated in a separate section of the restaurant for a traditional family dinner Then we saw some secret booths at the front which reminded us of downlow mob meeting places where nobody is going to see you spill the goods to the feds nnAn evening at Carluccios makes me rejoice in that for once Las Vegas has embraced its history and the owners of this place have decided to keep kitsch alive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>dFMxzHygTy6F873843dHAA</td>\n","      <td>Arcades, Arts &amp;

clean and well maintained Very friendly staff Despite being on Fremont St they do not have tourist prices Well bright well lit overall safe and fun environmentCame on a Sunday afternoon and there were a few other groups but it wasnt too crowded nnGreat games including all of the usual suspects and some newer stuff nReally good prize selection with reasonable redemption value Place was clean and well maintained and the two staff members were helpful and friendlynnLove that they still have tokens and physical tickets along with self serve ticket counter machines so you get the satisfaction of watching the machine dispense tickets but dont have to carry them around until the endMy husband  I stumbled upon this place People working are nice games are pretty fun The price for every game just a bit muchThis place is amazing  Jesses customer service is even better  Pac man  Time Crisis skee ball  pin balls machines  everything  And they ALL work  nA must go when Im downtown Vegas Old school vibe in a clean atmosphere with amazing serviceHad some time to kill before bar hopping on East Fremont so I walked over to give this place a shot It reminds me of the mall arcade I used to go to as a child Not a huge number of games to choose from but there is a variety in types of games pinball racing skee ball pop a shot air hockey shooters claw machines etcnnIt only gets three stars because it lacks in comparison to other arcades in Vegas Places like Dave  Busters and GameWorks blow this place away on size and variety Hotel arcades on the Strip are better options too eg Midway at Circus Circus and Big Apple Arcade at New York New York If youre a pinball fan the Pinball Hall of Fame has exponentially more machines and are cheaper to playnnI wouldnt go out of my way to visit again but ultimately its not bad It served its purpose when I had to kill 30 minutes Nothing more nothing lessNice and clean with fun games Pay the cashier directly to get extra ticketsdont use the machine Ok prizes and overall funI dont know how I just found out about this place but thankfully found it by mistake while wandering downtown with friends So this area is tucked away a lil near the mega dennys It is a tad small on the inside and most of the really cool games are 4 tokens a piece but enough boo hooing My friend and I had a blast at this place He was all about the mega space invaders game which was very fun but once I saw mario kart in an arcade my nostalgia ADD brain went into seek  destroy mode I believe you can have up to four racers at a time My friend picks the hardest track while he boasts his mario kart skills the race starts the 3rd player was left in the dust meanwhile him and I are neck and neck in the final lap and he is just about to cross the finish line when BOOM turtle shell obliterates him while i win the race D its just like the good ole days of playing either super or mario kart 64 with your friends Another fun game there was a new Crusin game which was great We didnt get a chance to explore the whole arcade or play some air hockey  but leaves us something to look forward to upon our next visit All in all this was a really neat area tucked away in fremont To the folks bitching about being tricked into spending alot of money for a crappy prize uh you ever been to chuck E Cheese P thats the way the tickets crumble I highly suggest checking out this place if you are in the area GAME ONI am so blessed I stumbled upon this place while I was out for the night I dont know how I didnt know about it since I live 5 minutes walking away Tucked away is probably whynnPlace is really simple and cool Come play some air hockey driving games skeeball or pinball For a small space they have some good games to play Some for prizes tickets or just funnnMy friends had a blast playing air hockey and pinball for an hour Place doesnt charge to go in and not over priced at all 1 is four token Most games take two tokens so a dollar goes far there nnDefiantly coming back for sure any day Im down there or just bored at home If you are on Fremont look this place up for some fun while you are visiting or living here If your have kids this is a great escape for you both Most adults Im sure could find something they like I know I didGreat employees great game choice Id highly recommend it to all the under 21 ers Actually Id highly recommend for anyone who likes games My husband and I took our 3 teenagers and we ha a couple hours of fun in air conditioning Very clean which is a huge plus as well  Go check it out its at the end of Fremont St past DennysGreat games Staff is always friendly and its always a fun time stopping in herenI do miss the pinball but such as lifeCame here over the weekend visiting from out of town  Awesome spot off Fremont St  Very nostalgic with cool games that remind me when I was a kid  they have a lot of new games that were a lot of fun too  Staff was greatIll definitely be back soonCheck grouponcom for at least a 50 coupon to get you started  I grabbed 10 in tokens for 5   That will get me warmed up   There are other deals for tokens upon arrival   Read the signs or ask the employeennI was there to play the pinball machines  Most machines were LEs limited addition models and in pristine condition   Some had tasteful modifications that added to the games play or aesthetics nnI also liked how youre allowed to bring in drinks from the outside   Water soda and of course beer and other alcohol   Not sure about foodnnAlso a big plus was the location its back in a nook   Off the main path of Freemont street where it can get a little weird and sometimes unsafe     The staff was nice and helpfulnnEnjoy    I will be back and back and back   This is a great alternative to the Pinball Hall of FameLow stars for the stupid way they trick you into coming in and spending money nnMy husband once ran an arcade and we both love that they are coming back but dont deceive people into thinking that they won something then force them to spend money to see what it is We probably only spent 10 and had a good enough time everything was in working order because the place is new I believe The have a bathroom which is a huge plus to me We liked the pinball games and the retro games like pacman nOur price was a 10 cent sucker Ironic I wonder what the teenage boy that won the big prize actually got20 was a long time of a ton of fun Get started upstairs with a couple of drinks and you cant go wrong Will definitely be backThis place rocks for its size Love the pinball machines Have a blast every time I go A place I take all my friends when they come into town And lets face it Id rather support small business in Vegas than the big places like Dave that dont give back to the communityOkay so its ALL ABOUT THE MARIO CART RACING I have never seen this game before in an arcade and it is so much fun The driving synchronizes nicely with what is expected It doesnt have delay or turn too hard or too little It feels responsive and what you would want from a turn Using the power ups is also a lot of fun because its partially skill based You have to aim most shells and other power ups which for me makes it a lot more fun I went back a couple times just for this and head to head racing with my SO lolnnAside from the mario kart game you can find the standard games youd expect in an arcade at fair prices and the staff is friendly Would recommend visitingGreat selection of pinball with well maintained games and a helpful attendant Best fun I have had in Vegas for 5Fremont Arcade is tucked behind Dennys on East Fremont on the first floor of Neonopolis Its a smallish arcade frequented by adults more so than by children My younger siblings and dad having frequented larger arcades in Vegas still had a lot of fun here My kid brother loved the basketball games and the old man gravitated towards a huge Galaga game This was hands down the most popular game in the arcade At some points people were queuing up to play this old classic Theres also a an old school Galaga game that only costs 2 tokens to play My dad played for like 15 minutes and got the second highest scorennThe drawback to this arcade is that its quite expensive Most games costs 4 tokens 1 to play We easily burned through our game play over the course of 30 minutes Even the pinball machines cost 4 tokens to play I seen that prizes are available but I didnt see any tickets being dispensed from the games so I dont know how prizes work here Still the Fremont Arcade is worth a visit especially if you have kids in townnYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017 16Made it  down there today  what fun experience Arcade was very clean a lot of games and the biggest Pac Man game Jesse was very helpful explaining the games Will return Wishing him much successIts cool Nothing special Largest PAC man game is dope Pretty expensive The old arced feeling is non existentThe Fremont Arcade is located directly off the Fremont St Experience in downtown Las Vegas I stopped in a few times during a recent trip to Las Vegas and had a great time They have a wonderful selection of games prizes worlds largest PacMan pinball and my favorite air hockey I went with my youngest sister and her husband and we had a BLAST We played a bunch of games and I laughed loudly during an exciting game of airhockey nnThe owner Jesse was there and he was very helpful and friendly He helped us when we couldnt figure out how to use the coin machine and showed us some games he thought we might like nnI would definitely recommend Fremont Arcade Its a great spotWaste of money lol I went in and spent 20 on coins for my BF and I only to find that they had a 25 package that includes 100 coins PLUS a medium sized plushy I top of that you dont even actually play to win a prizetickets Youre way better off going to Circus CircusThey got a really nice line up of pinball machines and arcade machines  All quality  If youre a pin fan and like Stern games this place is with a visitKids had fun All the games are 1 so you cant have too much fun without going broke lol All the machines were up and working Its smaller than what the pictures make it seem so I wouldnt come with too many ppl or you might end up waiting for others to get off a game Other than that next time Im on Freemont I may stop in and play a game or twoAnybody good at air hockey herenCant find a good opposer nDM mennGreat place to have fun BTW nDo not hesitate to try everythingI visited the Fremont Arcade today on a field trip with some students and they loved it This place is truly a hidden treasure  The arcade is super clean and there are tons of games for every age The addition of the ticketed games definitely was a hit with the kids Connor was super accommodating and ensured that we all had a great time If you are looking for a fun kidfriendly experience in Downtown Las Vegas look no further the Fremont Arcade is awesomeSUPERCHECKS HOCKEY need I say more  This place is great Tons of pinball too The place is clean and the staff is awesome You need to check it outIm always glad to see new businesses opening up in the downtown area I was especially excited to see a new arcade and in the old Neonopolis building I was devastated when Jillians closed as that was a regular spot for me when I was a teenagernnThis arcade has a lot of cool games and they have pinball which I love I was glued to the pinball machines on my last visit Its pretty spacious too at least for now Only gripe I have is that all the games are 4 tokens 1 each Hope they do some price adjusting but Ill definitely be back to try some more gamesThis is the place to go if you want arcade babay lol no malfunctiones no broken machines and no bs greatest host ever Jesse you are the best manThis place has the largest pac man game  Its a bit hard to get to but its a fun place if you have kids  There are no restroomsThis will be their 21st review and I couldnt be more happy to give it I know the general Yelp rule is to be skeptical of a 5 star average business with so few reviews but this place deserves it nnSmall but mighty Fremont Arcade is clean and air conditioned to the perfect temperature There is an employee on sight who greets you as you walk in and sits in the center console to answer any questions you may have hand out prizes and offer support if something is malfunctioning There arent any classic games in here other than a neat row of pinball machines Most games are newer or at least newer versions of older games They have a lot of shooting games you can play with a buddy including the Walking Dead and Transformers Transformers is ridiculous but fun It was probably my fave nnPrices are decent for what you get It IS Vegas The Pinball price was a tad much but the pinball machines are all in excellent condition Hobbit Pinball was a blast If someone is playing it you have to watch Theres basically a movie going on at the same time The Star Wars Battle Pod is SICK OMG I could play that thing ALL DAY nnThis might be the only arcade Ive ever been to where everything is pristine and in good working order No token eating to be found here There was one game that needed some jimmying but that was it The Fast  the Furious game even gave me a random free play for my crowning achievementof getting 5th place in a race What a treatnnI should have asked the Lone Gamer employee if this place just opened or something because it really was the perfect experience If a huge amount of people came running in here it probably wouldnt be as fun The space itself is not big That was the only potential hiccup I saw in design as Fremont Street can get slammed on weekend evenings nnYet another of my growing list of reasons why I prefer Fremont Street to the Strip Way to go Fremont Arcade You were an oasis for two nerds killing time between brekkie and Las RageousnnTip Yes theres a bathroom Yes theres a change machineGreat off the beaten path place to stop in while in Vegas and take a bit of a break from The Fremont Experience Lots of pinball selection was a little disappointed to be honest with the lack of old school stand up arcade games Ms Pacman Galaga Donkey Kong ect All in all ALOT of funCame on a Wednesday morning Conner helped us out he was super friendly Had alot of great token deals for the kids Spent about 5 hours here flew by but walked out with a game system console pool game and unicorn earsSome of the best maintained pinball machines youll find anywhere Has a good mix of games too including new Hobbit oneFremont Arcade is an awesome arcade right in the heart of Fremont Its a great break from all the hustle and bustle of Vegas All the games are new and work great The coin machine even takes a creditdebit card The owners are so nice too Do yourself a favor and pop on in hereThis place kicks ass Great games the pinball in fantastic Yeah I have the high score on the Worlds biggest ppacman who wants some heeheennWillie PSYCHOMe and a couple friends went to play some arcade gamesair hockey But after an hour we were short a few tokens and the clerk gave us enough to play a little bit morePinheads rejoicennIt is rare enough to find pinball on location but to find collectorquality LE machines complete with toppers skins and other mods on location is absolutely unheard of  But that is exactly what youll find at Fremont ArcadennThe owner Larry blesses us with his private collection that has been meticulously maintained and plays strong and fast  If youre in LV it alone is worth the trip downtown  Heck it alone is worth a trip to LV  Thank you Larry for your dedication to the pinball community</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","

Birthday not knowing what to expect I was down for anything at that moment Thomas was so pleasant and helpful as we were greeted and given front side stage seating VIP TREATMENT The men were respectful and very tasteful giving all the ladies attention as if they were the only one in the room I was given two stage performances one by Ready and boy was he READY so was I lol the other gentleman Speedy I guess was funny as hell I recommend this place if you wanna have fun that never endsladies bring your wallet things can add up Is it worth it  Hell yea Beware of Dave the MEANIE hes a driver for the mansion he will pick you up  and drop you off back to your hotel if the PRICE is right Otherwise your stuck at the mansion he will politely text you and say you didnt tip so no ride home plus Im off I simply laughed  Im from Oakland BABY I can get down lol staff handle the situation well providing drinks to me and my girls as they hooked up a ride for us Would I return yes  Thanks for a wonderful night fellas I do apologize for this late review                                                            nnnn                                                                                        TameikiaI planned a bachelorette party for my friend and there were 6 of us At first  we chose the 25 pp package with limo pickup admission and 2 drinks until I read in fine print does not include limo ride back to hotel So then we went with the package of 45 pp to include limo pickup and drop off VIP entrance reserved seating and 2 drinks All along they tell you please do not be late for limo pickup so I made sure we were on time however the limo was about 40 min late and not only that they show up in a shuttle bus Not cool And there was another group of girls with us which was ok but not what we paid for The driver did apologize and said there would be a limo to take us back Then we pull up to Hustler club No where in the info I looked up said it was at the hustler Again no big deal but wouldve been nice to know thats where it was at No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early Seated limited Ok so the male strippers were good with the girls and bride to be however their bodies were all so stubly or prickly as though the hadnt been freshly waXed or shaved A big turn off Never the less we had a good time I just wish it was a little more organized Ands since we paid that much money and then had to pay another 60 to get bride onstage was a little muchI came here for my 40th First of they offer free limo service to and from which was really cool  When we first arrived we were greeted by the manager he walked us up to the top floor where the male review was and told us we had the choice of seats wherever we wanted  We were also given two drink coupons per person so we ordered a drink and got seated The show started off slowly but what I really liked is the guys came out to sit and talk to you also they were really cool about taking pictures By the end of the night it was so crowded but it was amazing had the best time I definitely will be back I hope soonI love this Place  Every time Im in Vegas I stop by and have some fun at this place  I go to see Convict and the Cowboy  Great placeThis place is great And our waitress Jakki was awesome Forget Chippendales etc  This is the place to goLooks nice on the outside and on the pics but I was really disappointed  I met by best friend in Vegas for a girls weekend The limo for Hunk Mansion was scheduled to pic us up and never showedafter multiple phone calls and confusion between drivers as to who was coming to pick ua b up and then one getting into an acciddentit ended up being to close to closing to even goso we booked to go the second night They actually did pick us up in what was supposed to be a party bus for two of us I guess but looked like an airport shuttle with hunk mansion Written on the side  nWe got to the club and I was getting hopefulu was nucemusic was goodand we were told where to go for the men and immediately lost hope No one greeted usit was smallpretty emptyno energywe picked a tablethe guys were pretty hot but there were only 4 We sat waiting for a server and realized you go to the bar and get your own drinkswhich I did and they were pretty bad Finally one dancer came over to talk to ushe was very hotexplained how things workedthought things were going to get betterthen all the dancers disappeared for a stage show for the  Bachelorette dancewhich was pretty badwe calledOGS and leftdidnt even finish our crappy drinks All the bells but no whistlesvery disappointedMagic Mike eat your heart out These boys can dance  Take your bachelorettes here ladies Theyll hate you for a minute but love you for the rest of their livesMy friend and I made reservations online for 30 each which would get us a limo pick up admission and two drinks We were told to be downstairs at a certain area at 915 Our limo driver John was 1015 minutes late and then he couldnt find us I kept telling him where we were and he told us to go an opposite way All he had to tell us was that he was across the street from us Instead we walked down the street the wrong way and he flipped a uturn to get us When we got to the club with the other girls in the limo they told us he was already in a bad mood before he got us When we go to pay the cashier told my friend and I 40 each I argued saying we reserved for 30 but she said our ticket says 40 She told us wed get a ride back so we obliged The moment we sit down at a table 5 different guys were on us asking if we wanted a dance My friend pointed at me and I guess he whispered to her it was 25 We said nevermind We had JUST sat down and wanted to warm up and get the feel of the place these guys were pushy All of us at the table agreed we were thinking thered be a stage show and then mingling time Instead there was a few short stage shows and the guys were doing lap dances at the same time as the show Youd think theyd give eachother enough respect to not do lap dances during the show since the guy on stage could make more money if everyone was paying attention to him We spent a few hours here and we were told to call our limo driver for the return ride I called and texted him Waited 45 minutes without a response When I asked one of the girls at the main entrance downstairs for help she said there was nothing they could do since it was another company in a mean tone and practically rolling her eyes This makes me think it happens more times then not We ubered out of there instead This experience was supposed to be fun and exciting but instead it felt like a rip off and the customer service was AWFUL and NONEXISTENT Only help I had was from Thomas who offered us another night with some shots but honestly we never want to go back I asked for the difference we were forced to pay without getting a ride back and I got that within a few daysHonestly I have never posted a review on yelp and Im pretty wary of bad reviews  But I encourage you to never visit hunk mansion I did a lot of research for this place and every promise was broken  I got the set of tickets that includes a reserved table but once we got there pretty much all the tables were taken and we had a party of 5 which is hard to accommodate When we got there we asked where we would sit and the lady at the front said that we could sit anywhere I specifically asked if we could sit at tables with reserved signs and she said yes But we sat at a table with a reserved sign and the manager said wed have to buy a 350 bottle to sit there We went to the first lady to say she told us it was ok to sit there and she ended up saying we had to speak to the manager He ended up telling us we could have the seats and a bottle for a generous discount of 150 We declined and he said he was overbooked and there was nothing he could do about it We obviously argued that we paid for the reserved table and he would not budge We ended up waiting and finding a table Then even though we were upset and tried to make the best of it we were told as part of our ticket price wed get 2 free drinks When we tried to get our second drink we were told that we couldnt redeem our drink tickets after an hour even though literally no one said that and the website didnt say it either Honestly it was my birthday and I wanted to have fun but it pretty much ruined my experience NEVER come to hunk mansion They just lied and treat you like crap when you try to get what was promised to youSuch an amazing place We came here with a group of 11 girls for my friends 30th and it was everything we could of hoped for and more Such a fun experience the guys were very nice and very very built Loved watching the guys and their routines I cant say enough good things about Hunk Mansion We seriously had the best time and I will for sure be coming backPerfect place for a bachelorette party Everyone had a great time Excellent service from the VIP host bartender and cocktail waitress Jakki The dancers are amazingSo much fun It was my friends birthday Shed not been with a man in quite some time and she was a selfdescribed prude I needed an environment where she could cut loose and have fun but feel safe and comfortable Id spoken with the manager ahead of time and hed been exceptionally honest in saying that he couldnt promise me the best seats etc He could have just taken my money but he didnt and I really appreciated his honesty Theres a story about a different group who were totally skeevy He said instead that we were most likely to get great seats if we arrived earlier in the evening rather than later The two of us were picked up by free limo in exchange for having to buy two drinks each Thats fair especially as it was only 50 total for all four drinks We got there early and the women around us were still too sober We brought our own fun to counteract the grumpy grumpsters behind us That was around 830 pm I think But the men were already dancing and they were all just gorgeous gorgeous men Those fabulous dancers were immediately attentive and charming And soon the place was hopping We enjoyed a number of very attentive dances without having to share until the place got packed around 1230 AM When we left it was full of crazy women having an awesome and amazing time I guess the key is to make sure your bachelorette or birthday group isnt full of pissy women and come prepared with a good attitude nnAs to how Hunk Mansion compares to others my previous experience with strippers involved a couple of local shows at home Men of X MOX Thunder from Down Under TFDU and Olympic Gardens OG MOX and TFDU are just male revues in which you sit amongst way way way too many women and have no real interaction with the guys At TFDU for example a bride seated in the middle of our overpacked table kept walking into the aisles and trying so hard to have interactions with guys While very inexpensive those shows are so impersonal and lame as to be a waste of time And forget getting drinks at the overpacked bars of the male revues Hunk Mansion is SO much better than those places The men at HM were all over us and my friend got all of the attention she could possibly want It was easy enough to get drinks at the bar and the bartender was such a sweetheart and outrageous flirt Any woman would feel honored by the attention It was nice that not only did my friend whose birthday we were celebrating get some affection but so did I as her buddy nnAs to how it compares to OG Hunk Mansion is way better I swear that most of the men at OG the last time that I was there were on drugs were not very good dancers and only one guy had seemed to actually have any interest in being sensual with women Whereas at Hunk Mansion the men love women Holy moly Hector is insanely sensual That guy looooooves women Seriously get a dance or five from Hector Theyre also more athletic and better dancers I felt like OG was totally lame and I wondered why women got shafted excuse the pun at strip clubs Why do the men only get high quality and beautiful dancers Whereas at Hunk Mansion its what a woman would hope to experience at a strip club nnI also liked that the men at Hunk Mansion were upfront with prices and expectations so you knew exactly what youd get and it was a very fair transaction Much as in real relationships its always better when theres honesty involvedI have never been to a strip club before and I am so glad this was my first experience I am hooked The guys here are SO nice and SO FCKN HOTTTT Its been a week since I went and Im still daydreaming about that night it was AMAZING It is definitely entertaining and the guys put on a really good show If you are in vegas for some fun you definitely have to stop by at least one of your nights It is so worth it Trust me The guys will not disappoint Were already planning our next visit pI love this place I will be back everytime I come to Vegas My friend and I had so much fun The guys are super hot Not to sure about Ted but whatever floats your boat they have it  Hahaha The 30 cover charge is a great deal for a limo ride to and from your hotel and 2 drinks I wouldve spent more than that on just a cab I liked that it wasnt too crowded and we were able to find a table and this was a Saturday night  Waiting in line outside kind of sucked but it went quick My only regret is that I was so nervous this being my first time at a male strip club that I drank too much too quick and we had to leave earlier than my friend wouldve liked I cant wait to go back Ive told all my friends about it and well have a much bigger group next timeWorst male review EVER Stay clear ladies unless you like watching little boys walk around in their tennis shoes A complete joke and total let down only two dancers that even looked like gown men and the female manager was as rude as they come Not worth the cost or your timeThis was definitely the HIGHLIGHT of my bachelorette weekend I had been to a small male strip club many years ago in LA and I remember it being just ridiculous and thinking man this doesnt even turn me on unlike when guys go to strip clubs and totally get turned on by female strippers I thought this experience was going to be the same but I was wrong The strippers are pretty hot ahem pitbull and mojito and I actually got turned on by one of them during my lap dance because he was THAT good My gfs and I said we were just going to be there for an hour or so at max so we could go clubbing on the strip afterward but we ended up staying here longer because we all couldnt get enough of the men and craziness plus we all wanted lap dances I now know why guys can spend hours and a ton of money at strip clubs haha My gfs and I still reminisce about hunk mansion weeks later talking about how it was the best life decision we made that weekend If youre deciding between this and a thunder down under type of show I would go with this all the way This is way better way more interaction and overall guaranteed wild and fun time Thank you for the best weekend everMy friend and I went here for my birthday weekend a week ago today and boy let me tell you these men know what theyre doing  very sexywe will definitely returnits going to be our tradition every time were in Vegas which is quite a few times a year  thank you hunk mansion to the best birthday a girl can ask forsee you soonThey have great online deals for special events and occasions We got picked up and dropped off like queens with great service frm beginning to end Definitely will be booking more events at this place Come with extra cash ladies its worth every pennyTheres a little something for everyone here A guy of every type for every type of lady Came here for a bachelorette and they did treat our party like queens Lots to see and do Were having an absolute ball Yes its just as risquxc3xa9 as you think so dont bring your prudish friend cuz shell be upset Come with a GREAT attitude and you will have a GREAT timeThis place is AMAZING Great place for a bachlorett party  Arrow and Pittbull are great We had a BLASTLiterally just left Hunk Mansion at Larry Flynts Hustler Club Im celebrating my 52nd birthday and I wanted to party so we paid 45 for the VIP package which included two drinks and RT limo service Our previous experience had been to see the Men of Sapphire We immediately liked The Mansion better The limo driver was personable the hostess Karen was a sweetheart giving us two seats in the first row center stage The dancers were charming and very sexy even those who werent my particular type Im a sister I like thick thighs and a nice butt  It was Sunday not crowded but a fun crowd so we got a fair deal of personal attention Based on these things Id give the Mansion five stars The one star rating Im actually giving is because of the abysmal customer service we received from security and management I gave my niece 20 to buy a drink when she handed me the change I noticed that a third of the 5 bill she gave me was missing The drama began when she tried to exchangereturn it for one that wasnt mutilated We were first told that the 5 bill was real this was never in question We were then asked if we planned to buy something else as if that would impact our getting a 5 bill that was not practically torn in half Finally we were told that we would need to wait for security to review the tape to verify that the bartender gave us the bill and that this would not happen until the club closed Of course this was a ruse to try to frustrate us into saying forget it As Hakeem says in the Geico ads not today and I said no problem We didnt have to wait but after they reviewed the security tape we were told that when my niece accepted the change the responsibility was hers whatever the fcuk that means Really As Judge Judy would say thats a whole lot of who shot John ie nonsense over 5 Im in Vegas at least three times a year always for my birthday and usually with some girlfriends Im not a gambler so Im always looking for entertainment The Mansion went from a must to a bust in the span of about three hours The poor customer care was unbelievable Oh well cest la vieWe went to Hunk Mansion for our best friends bachelorette party on a Saturday night and Im so happy we did We had a wonderful time and the dancers servers front staff and London Steele were really sweet to us group of girls from Canada Our bride to be was smiling and laughing so hard her cheeks were aching after spending several hours at Hunk Mansion nAlso like the previous poster mentioned Kobe Colby he was making a movement of playing basketball so Im guessing Kobe spelling hehe was really entertaining and super cute I think he was EuropeanAsian mix so hot and our group thought he was the friendliest one He even hugged us all bye when we were about to jump into the elevator Props to him for making our group feel special Also theres a nice diversity to the men dancing so youll definitely find your favourite male dancer The men were all amazingly talented any man can bump hard and grind slow but actually having some dance skills is a bonus in my opinion nnLastly I would say for Canadian girls looking for a safe clean and exciting place to spend their bachelorette this is the place to be We spent 50  USD each and received a round trip limo ride from our hotel and 2 free drinks each The tables werent reserved but it was easy enough to get a bunch of tables beside the stage and there was 9 of usnnSide note the host London Steele is the man who inspired Dallas from Magic Mike the movie with Channing Tatum He was so nice to our group Ohhh and dont take photos or else the DJ will call you out and boot you out of the mansionNOT GAY FRIENDLYnnWe wanted to surprise one of my girlfriends for her b day as soon as we go there they notice us guys and would not approach my best friend maria When asked if my best friend can get a lap dance they responded saying they would give her a lap dance as long as my best friend or myself werent asking for onenndiscrimination at its finest I even had my Straight good friend defend us by saying that even if we did want a lap dance what would be so awful about itnn trust me if it were up to me I would be spending my money somewhere else but given the fact that I was trying to do something thoughtful for my girlfriend I was stuck on this one or just wait until we got back to Hollywood from our trip SMHGreat experience  The dancers are hot hot hot  They are also friendly and they dont seem thirsty like the men at other clubs They give a good show and they also work the crowd I will definitely be backI booked my sisters bachelorette here and it was amazing the bus picked us from the hotel to the venue and then drove us back strippers are very good looking and super nice and trust me they know how to dance I thought the personal lap dances were to expensive tho 25 for me is too much Drinks are a little over price as well but other than that the service was amazing and fun Lame is all I have to say Went on a friday night and Only 5 dancers The lap dances suck the men are more about showing you tricks and dance moves than grinding against you Dont waste your cash here at all There is a reason why after all these years this place doesnt have many reviews The only plus about this place is the guys are nice to talk too As for looks most are skinny not many are muscular and a few seemed possibly gayWent on a Sunday unlimited top shelf liquor And it was really top shelf Men are super handsome And great service  Will definitely return againCame to this place and I have no idea what everyone else is thinking with any review worth more than 1 star except they MUST be crazy  Please reconsider going here  Im serious  Im from Miami and we went to Vegas for a bachelorette  Ive been to Vegas plenty of times but never done a strip club  We went on a Thursday and arrived close to 10 pm  The place was pretty much dead  There might have been 6 other women there  The lights werent really dimmed and the DJ was just plain bad  Paying 30 regardless of how they want to market it by including free things is terrible  I wouldnt have paid 5 for this place  The guys come up to you and talk but they dont really do anything sexy to make you want to get a lap dance or pay for anything  Normally strip clubs have male dancers  This is what a strip club doesthey get guys that are hot to dance and then women want to give them their money  Its a simple rule to follow  We stayed for 20 minutes before we decided to make a run for the elevator  Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied  Dont make the same mistake we did by letting the other reviews influence you into going  They must have never seen a man before or know what a strip club is  TERRIBLEIve never been to a place like this and I didnt know what to expect Hunk Mansion felt like a speakeasy with a hidden room and entrance inside the much large Hustler Club We were given directions by one of the cashiers on how to find it go down the long dark hallway and make a right by the 6 Golden Boner and then make a left by beaver bucks then walk to the end of yet another hallway It was one of those times I asked myself did she say what I thought she said  At this point I had no idea what to expect but we were on a mission to have the best bachelorette party we can nnThe staff was friendly and the dancers were very professional We felt safe here as it was well lit and we could see everything that was going on  It was a Saturday night and the energy was high Our host was Thomas and he kept coming back to check on us to make sure we were having fun and we most certainly didThese guys are great they know how to make the women happy I recommend that you send your wife or girlfriend there to cut loose and have some fun Management here is really nice and service is great Ladys in Vegas are in for a treatAmazing time 19 girls for a bachelorette not a glitch organized All staff is greatThe dancers were extremely hot and the majority of them were so nice The problem we had was when we asked if my gay best friend could get a lap dance for his 21st birthday a lot of the dancers said they dont allow that there Some finally told us that the owner only allows them in secret rooms and its 150 for 15min instead of the normal 2025 That is complete discrimination and shameful on the owner We finally went to the girl section so he could at least get some kind of lap dance and girl on girl or lesbian action was allowed downstairs The discrimination there is just terrible and although we made friends with the strippers will never returnLadies skip the impersonal big name male revues and head to Hunk Mansion for your night out  They have someone for everyone whatever your flava man youll find it there Every guy starting with the host Thomas the DJ the bartender and all the dancers is there to make sure you have the time of your life and they deliver the fun in spades Youll get everything you want in a night out drinks dancing and attention  without the ridiculous hassle of your typical dance clubThis place is amazing  Great place for a  party  The dancers are great and fun to PLAY with  Defiantly recommend this place for a bride to beThis was the first male strip club Ive been to and I was pretty disappointed There were about 5 dancers and only one guy was good looking IMO see picture He was also the only good dancer so they definitely saved the best for last The first dancer from Cali was extremely awkward to watch he must be newnnI expected it to be much more fun and wild for a bachelorette party but it was pretty chill There werent very many people there for a Thursday night eitherFirst off our host Thomas was awesome   Kept in contact with me the day off confirmed our pick up time etc  When I called our driver for a ride home he said he may or may not be available in 30 minutes  Thomas got us a ride straight away   So thank you    n nWe came here with 11 girls for my sisters bachelorette party on a Saturday night  We booked the party package that included an onstage with the bride and entry  Its an additional 30 dollars per girl for 2 drink tickets  I think a pretty good bang for your buck lol   It is a must to get on that giant golden penis and have a photo  That thing is hilarious   nnFor some reason every host we had for different events didnt recommend this place  They all were recommending Men of Sapphire or Chippendales  Since I went to Men of Sapphire for my bachelorette party years ago I wanted something different for my sister   This is completely a different experience and a more one of one than Men of Sapphire  Men of Sapphire have more of a stage and you sit afar and watch more of a show Hunk Mansion the stage is super close and the men use the poles and engage more with the audience    If you want a crazier night then do Hunk Mansion   Plus I found the men a lot sexier at Hunk Mansion than Men of Sapphire   nnThe guys were all superhot expect the little annoying Guido guy he was our least favorite   However all the guys even little Guido had awesome pole skills and every guy was very engaging to all the females     If you do the package you can pick the guy you want on stage  So beware you will be bombarded when you first get there  So just like Larry H Parker they will all fight for you  I asked the bride to be whom she wanted   So I recommend the same to other bride to bes  Oh and seriously girls if you want your crotch displayed than where a dress  If not I recommend wearing jeans   nnThe pickup and drop off  nWe were picked up on time but the bus that took us was super old air continuing sucked and the speakers were blown in the back  The ride home was a lot nicer the party bus was awesome working air light show  I would definitely retire the one that picked us up especially in Vegas heat we were all sweating in that busnnThey have hookah at an additional price  I thought a pretty cool option   nnThe only dislike of the entire night is when I just got a beer and they let the ladies dance on the stage  Some chick hit my beer with her shoe and spilled it on the ground and everyone saw even the bartender  Luckily it didnt hit me or my friends  Its 15 bucks for a beer since I used a drink ticket  So logically since I didnt dump it and it was their fault they should replace it  Different story if I spilled the drink I would of just bought another and owned up to it  But it was obvious they knew the girl did it  The bartender gave me total attitude but did give me a replacement but he definitely didnt want to  He said oh any other place wouldnt do it I was quite pissed for a 50 cent beer I got such attitude  Not from Stixxxs but the other one   Stixxxs was super cool lite your cigarette for you made some pretty awesome shots Its the little things that girls remember and such a small gesture would of gone miles   But he decided to be a dick about it   nnOverall I gave 5 stars even with the rude bartender because the show was great and everyone had a great time  nnOh and seriously a must to stop by the Hustler store  They have some awesome stuff in thereTHE SECRET IS TO TEXTCALL YOUR DRIVER  If you purchase a package thats supposed to include round trip limo they DO NOT tell you how to get your free ride back and then the hostess will argue with you about whether you purchased the right package 12 of my party was forced to pay for a cab ride home and the other 12 that stayed longer had to keep arguing with the hostess  wait at least 30min after they finally agreed to let them take the limo home  Thomas was annoyed to handle my complaint but he did refund the prepaid money for the 12 of the group that paid the cab fare instead of getting the full benefit of the package we paid fornnOther than that I really enjoyed the time I spent there for my bachelorette party  The men are very good looking and encourage you to touch if youre into that kind of thing   Very entertaining show though I wish I remembered more of what happened after I went up on stage lol  Theyre pretty generous with their included drink couponsThe DJ plays great music Drinks are strong Dancers are sexy Our bride is having the time of her life with the lap dances Really enjoyed the champagne offered in our section Good times were had by allWas not overly impressed We have been talking about Hunk Mansion for a friends bachelorette party for months and decided to finally book the reviews sounded great and we were so excited about the mechanical penis We were all ready to throw down however much it would cost to get the bachelorette a ride on it We called to book our reservation and the guy on the phone was rude We specifically had questions about when to arrive in order to be able to sit all together and he told us he wouldnt be able to seat us together unless we reserved a table for more money The table reservation included two free drink tickets each so we went ahead with it Our driver was very nice and the ride was pleasant but we arrived at Hustler Everyone kept reassuring us this was actually Hunk Mansion though there was not a single sign that said anything confirming we were actually in the right location We were able to go in fairly quickly but in order to get to the male strip club they walked us through the female strip club which once again did not make us feel like we were in the right place since Hunk Mansion was so advertised as being geared towards women When we got up to the venue the view was nice both in scenery and eye candy but the place was empty except one other party Good thing we were pressured into buying the more expensive package to get a table together We were swarmed with good looking guys very nice but also VERY persistent in pressuring us to buy expensive dances and drinks I went with my friend to use our free drink tickets she ordered champagne and I ordered wine As she was talking to me I witnessed the bartender begin to pour her glass of champagne then when he thought we werent looking swap to another unlabeled bottle that was already open then when she turned around he finished it off with the original champagne bottle I told her what had happened and the bartender denied switching bottles even though I had watched him He ended up giving her the rest of the mini champagne bottle for free after we complained Later on we decided to buy shots the special was 5 Malibu shots and when they came out they were pink Since when is Malibu pink I might have overlooked all this if they actually had a mechanical penis as advertised but there was none to be found  This was not our first rodeo but definitely our last at Hunk MansionI would like to give a huge shout out to Thomas at Hunk Mansion  He rolled out the red carpet for me and my two sisters neither had ever been to a strip club before last night on short notice He had the limo pick us upthe driver was in constant contact so we knew when and where to meet Getting in the club was a smooth process and i LOVE the new venue The guys were hot there were plenty to pick from and a nice variety especially for a Thursday night  We had a great time and the guys were good with my sisters who were a bit uptight at firsthaha The other women all appeared to be having a great time as well whether they were there for a bachelorette party part of a couple or group of ladies I must saywell done Thomas and Men of Hunk MansionMannnn do I have lots to say about this place good and bad We came here for a bachelorette party on 11417 that we prebooked with a group of us girls had no idea where it was until I realized its part of the Hustler Club nnGood nThe place is pretty nice There is a bar a stage plenty of seats and tables as well as an outdoor area outdoor area was my fav Everything was fairly clean and nice as well as the restrooms Not as large as Sapphires stage and room but still well done nnThe amount they charged us to get in was fairly reasonable I believe 3045 which includes transportation and two well drinks Not exactly sure which deal we gotnnAlsoYou have some pretty awesome people working there nIxtsel the hostess at the front David our hostserver at the table Trent behind the bar and Marcus the DJ were all a great help They answered any and all questions I Had and were very friendly Trent and David helped us finally get some water after asking several times and Ixtsel even sent a follow up email to me that night When all of us were waiting on paid dances for the bride maid of honor and friends DJ Marcus was able to reassure me they had gotten it helped us stay on a schedule and let us know when to be ready nThank you to themnnBadn1 The bus taking us to the event was hard to contact and did not finally contact us until 20 minutes after I had talked to another man We were late and picked us up about 4045 minutes after the original pick up time Do you know how stressed that makes a Maid of Honor with everyone at the hotel room nn2 Once we got there and had gotten seated we had so many people who worked there telling us we had to move then that we didnt have to move then that we had to pay 200 then that we had to pay 400 on top of the entrance fee nPLEASE just give us a manager and let them tell us the exact amount nn3 Afterwards when we did get a manager we were told that it was the wrong table that they had to talk to and that we were able to stay nBut of course only AFTER one of us has paid 300 for a bottle because we thought we had to leave Way to hustlenn4 Obviously these guys work on tipslap dance money So yes some of them are fairly aggressive If youre not good at saying no dont go here Luckily Im pretty good at eyeing them to back off hahahahha nn5 The bride had to pee as soon as we got out of the place Most places dont let you back in which is fine Just dont blame it on her being too drunk Just say its because we need to pay again to enter We get itnn6 The entertainment was fairly slow At some points no one was on stage and you could barely figure out why you paid money and you were sitting there with no guys around Every now and then a show would take place with some guy and their lap dance person after the DJ would call for that person 5x to get them on stage No schedules Also very rarely was I impressed with some of the guys dancing At least they look good right nn7 Obviously the ATM is a NO GO other than your bank There are always fees when using ATMs No matter what But normally its around 375 high NOPE This one charged 12 DONT DO IT nn8 Dont bother checking in for that Free Shot Didnt even work when I went up and asked for that person AND you get a nasty look like you faked the check in offer I never want to feel that way when presenting a Yelp check in offer nnTo summarize Hunk mansion is within the Hustler club and you will get hustled Hold your ground call for management when needed for your ride because they wont call you to tell you their late ask when in doubt about pricing and ASK for a manager rather than taking word from 4 different hosts dont think youll get anything without nagging for it and be friendly with the staff Some of them can make your night and give the place more starsIn town for a bachelorette party and really wanted the bride to be entertained We paid 30 per person for a party bus to take use there and back as well as entrance fee and 2 drinks Lap dances were 25 cash and 70 for the stage one I think it was worth it very entertaining Diversity of the men was good multi racial all flavors I do think some guys were better than others I wish they were more oiled up Props to Colby Kobe He was so entertaining and ladies into halfies he was half korean and polish cute in the faceThis was the best thing Ive done in a long timethe guys are incredible You get treated like a queen the dudes are beautiful and they have moves like youve never seenmy girls took me last week for my bachelorette party i had so much fun the 50 shades of grey guy  was amazing he tied me up in chains and all thomas went out of his way to find us a ride back to the venetian because no driver wanted to take us back we had a drunkie with us he gave us a bucket in case and found a ride for us i would recommend this place to anyoneThe guy at the door was rude and tried to charge us for drinks even though the package said it was included then when wetted to leave there limo drivers were talking shit about our group while we were standing there when I said I can hear you and it was unacceptable he said fine you can take a cab then and walked away Unbelievable service here from the staff completely ruins the experience and wasnt cheapMy last review has Thomas making a comment that i must be a competitor  I would like to state clearly that neither my friend or myself even live in Nevada much less have anything to do with a strip club except visit when we come to town But his response to my critical review only solidified my overall opinion of how things are run at the male venue at Hunk Mansion  Instead of trying to rectify a situation or improve customer servicethey blame the customers accuse them of being fakeor dont even respond  Your competition doesnt need to put fake posts on Yelp you make yourself look bad with your poor service on the front and back end Celebrated by besties bachelorette party here I had requested a limo but was picked up in a party bus instead no music no fun When we got to the venue our seating arrangement wasnt the most comfortable one either But once I bickered with the manager we got a few comfortable seats and were able to enjoy ourselves Girls You have to try this place It was funI went with a group of 11 ladies for a bachelorette party Besides walking through our group on the way to the stage the guys gave us no attention at all I actually had to get up and walk around to find a guy standing around to give my friend a dance We all had money to spend and couldnt get a guy to come over to us nnAlso we were sitting near the guys dressing room and I could hear them complaining about having to go on stage for another dance It was only 10 oclock so Id hate to see them by 2 nnWhile OG isnt as nice of a venue the guys and the service is a thousand times better nnOverall bad experience Were actually planning a makeup bachelorette party for my friend at OGMy husband and I come to Vegas about once a month and for a while wed been considering finding a couples friendly club that had male and female revues  After contacting Tom very fast to respond to make sure it was couples friendly we booked our VIP pass with round trip Limo service and waited eagerly for the weekendnnWe were picked up with a gold Escalade which was clean and comfortable  Driver was very amicable and kept the conversation going return trip was prompt  The check in process at the front was quick and easy the girl at the male review was prompt and explained the rules and prices clearly  My husband can watch the basic lap dances but hed have to wait outside on the private dances  No big deal  We were seated about three rows back from the stage but its an intimate venue so all seats are good  nnAt first the guys didnt approach and I can understand they probably dont know how to gauge if a husband is going to flip out or notso I decided to put the money out on the table to give the hint that we were there to have a good time and later when I wanted dances I had my husband give the guys the money and ask for me so they could know hes cool with it  nnGuido was the first one to come say Hi  So I treated myself to a basic dance with tips  Dont underestimate Guido he has awesome control of his body and is very friendly  Romeo was also awesome  Was waiting for his stage performance from the get go and I bought a private from him  Very sexy  nnLoved watching the guys on stage the place was full of energy  Loved the up close and personal feel of the event  Guys are friendly and live for the opportunity to make you feel special for a Jackson or two or three  nnIf you are a big girl like me dont be intimidated the guys are there to show you a good time  They were very courteous to my husband they acknowledged his presence and shook his hand  I had a great time he had a great time  We cannot wait to come backnnSome tips for othersn1  This is not a commercial male review with cheesy dance routines where you sit 20 rows back and just stare  This is an intimate exposure with beautiful diversified men in real life  They are touchable conversational and available for special attention in the form of lap dances stage dances and privates  If you are not cool with that go see the missing thunder and rainbow team of chip and dalesnn2 Lap dances leave you feeling a little special and little exposed  Stage dances leave you feeling very special and very exposed  Private dances leave you feeling extremely special in an intimate setting  Pick your pleasure Very disappointing Booked my friends bachelorette party there and I would definitely not suggest it to anyone else I paid 30000 plus tax for the whole thinglimo service and one dance for the bride on stageoh and a cheap ass lighted tiara Says on the website there is a 2 drink minimum for each party guest and lists the price of drinks at 1250 and upso on top of the 300 for a bachelorette package each girl then had to shell out another 30 at the door for 2 very shitty drinks Venue was tiny with hardly any room near the stage so quite a few of us had drinks spilled on us by other guests and dancersand the mechanical riding cock wasnt even working which was just total shit The place is pretty shady and dirty looking and they had maybe one to two good male stippers I had to give it one star because it wouldnt let me give it a zero Never againDont waste your money ladies it isnt worth itwe should have just gone clubbingMy first thought when I walked in was Holy Crap ITS RAINING MEN Lots of hot guys with six pack abs and gorgeous faces The men are so kind playful and sexy If you want romance or seduction they will give it to you If you want to be picked up and thrown around youll get that My suggestions are to come with plenty of cash atm fee is 25 take their transportation and spend most of your money on the lap dances 20 rather than on the stage Buy dances for your friends and theyll buy dances for you until youre comfortable buying your ownWe took my BFF to the Hunk Mansion last week for her 50th Birthday We had the time of our life The dancers were extremely sexy and went above and beyond  to make sure we had the time of our lives My favorite was Tyson  I think Im in Love Make sure to make a reservation they willnPick you up and drop you off from your hotel You also get two free drinks if you make a reservation We are already planning on going back in MarchWere celebrating 2 bachelorettes and from the point of booking online to the end of the night was perfect There was continue communication between Thomas TJ our driver to London Everything was fun fun funI had previously written a review giving Hunk Mansion one star because of an incident that occurred when I was given change after purchasing a drink I am changing my rating from 1 star to 5 stars which is the rating I would have given before the incident with my change  because the management of Hunk Mansion was diligent in responding to my concerns Without making excuses they explained that they lease the space from Larry Flynts Hustler Club Regardless of who was responsible I appreciate good customer service and the follow up by both Tenya and Thomas was just that I really enjoyed the show and will definitely return on my next trip to Vegas Ill just make sure to carefully inspect my change before leaving the bar This was definitely way more fun than expected Went for my sisters bachelorette with 12 girls and we had a blast The men were beautiful and super fun not overly aggressive like we imagined Its worth paying to get your guest of honor on stageshell thank you for it later The cowboy was 1 on most of our lists but theres someone for every tasteMy first time at a male club and I didnt know what to expect when I walked in with our group It mustve been a dead night as there were a few other women around the tiny ramp they called the stage The lighting and the overall bare look of the place is what hit me the most We had to get our own watered down drinks as there was one waitress who didnt bother coming around I would highly recommend you know what youre signing up for one of their routines when you get a stage dance for 60 Ill know what to expect on my next visit Why come back The men They had the charm and persona to match their six packs and I love how they can read what you want and give you exactly that We ended up spending the night hanging out with a couple of sweet funny guys who made us feel so comfortable and not out of place at all Cheers Randy Aka Mojito  nPlease get an upgrade a good interior design and some mood lighting HMHunk Mansion is the ultimate night club for erotic entertainment with gorgeous hunks to fulfill your wildest fantasies We had the most amazing night and experiences to match  We plan to make other trips back to Hunk Mansion real soon Look out Vegas here we come This is my favorite strip club whenever Im in Vegas The men here are all very talented and sexy My favorite stripper is ecstasy he is so sexy And I love the way he dance The drinks are very good not water down at all Lets not forget about the DJ he was total bad ass playing all the hottest songs My friends and I will be back again In November 2017Went here for Bachorlete party We were picked up by a SUV The guy was about 20 minutes late but apologized when picking up saying something about traffic He was a fast driver  made us feel comfortable when being in his vehiclenI was nervous when walking in because of the intimidating bouncers that greet you at the door When you walk in there is a giant penis which is funny to take pics with There is a guys side and girls side Way more girl dancers then guys We went to the section with the male dancers The dancer who came to talk to me was Guido Torpedo I told him right away I was not very comfortable  a little freaked out for what may be in store for me Guido was very comforting  instead of acting how I thought a stripper would be he was sweet  listened to me babble for hoursI got a personal lap dance from him  before the dance he actually asked what I would like to see him in nI giggled like a school girl  told him I was not into gstrings or sparkly outfits I asked if her had just a pair of jeans He laughed  said he has his street clothes  usually doesnt wear them because they are restricting when dancing  but said he would do it for me When he came back I was still very nervous to get the dance so he gave me a few while I downed some drinks with the girls trying to get some liquid courage When he came back the dance was great I felt comfortable  he was not too pushy at all For the 36 minutes he was dancing I was lost in the moment Thanks to him for a great 1st time dancer experience He represents your company well The bartender that looks like Little Wayne was awesome He kept our drinks flowing  was very easy to talk to He was also smiling the whole night  taught me how to use a condom On a HOOKAH that is My only complaint about the mens side was a older blonde woman that must have been a manager of some sort She lingered at the end of the bar  I felt like she was watching us the whole time Very awkward feeling The DJ was also cool  let us girls over take his booth requesting any dumb song we wanted The place was empty so it felt like the whole place was to ourselvesnThe girls side was a lot bigger When we walked over there TRENCH was preforming We danced  singed along to all of his songs Even got to sit in VIP with COOLIOnYes he is still alive The drinks by the male strippers were decently priced but on the other side I paid 15 for a Corona OuchnThe dancer were all kind making small talk whenever we would run into them All around a cool place to have a little party at And again Guido Torpedo was the bestWent here for a friends bachelorette party We didnt know what to expect since it was our first time in a place like this but overall we had a lot of fun For only 25pp we were piked up in an SUV given tickets for 2 free drinks and had access to both the male and female strip areas The bartenders were great the place was packed and the shows were quite entertaining Definitely a must go place for a bridal party if you dont want to spend tons on going to the shows like Chippendales and Thunder From Down UnderOkay I got a package deal it said we will picked up by a limo but instead we got pick up by a suv with no air conditioner Then we arrive to the club went us stairs the men were okay but some were drity and creepy At the end of our night it said that our driver was suppose to take us back to our hotel but he didnt I called him 3 times no answer So I suggest u look other places maybe stripper King I would give this place no stars Very disappointed with this place and serviceOur bachelorette group had so much fun The staff was friendly and service was great But mainly the dancers were fantastic So much funHad a great time at the hunk mansion The guys are ripped friendly and put on a great show  what more could you want For 20 bucks extra we got a round trip limo ride which was a nice touch The mansion is definitely a must for bachelorettes or anyone who wants to unwind The host Thomas will personally see to it that you have a good time Unparalled customer service Will definitely be back here againIve been here twice the second time was much better than the first definitely coming back  However the reason why Im giving 4 stars is because there was lack of communication due to transportation and payment  The strippers are awesome though  Had a great timeRecently I learned that theres a shortage of male strip clubs and revues in Las Vegas Thats definitely news to someone me who doesnt think the concept is appealing With that being said I was actually the one who found this place  via Yelp heh  and suggested to my female cousins  who are male strip club aficionados   that they add Hunk Mansion to their itinerary In short I ended up going for the hell of it to see why they get so worked up over guys gyrating in sparkly thongsnnEntry fee to the club is 25 This price includes two free drink tickets and shuttle service from your hotel via Hustler bus Thats a pretty sweet deal considering how entry fees alone to some of the clubs on The Strip are around the same pricennHunk Mansion is located inside Larry Flynts Hustler Club thats just a short drive from the south end of The Strip Its a small intimate room thats next door to where the women perform Its equipped with a bar large stage and plenty of seating and tables nnThe free drinks we ordered were weak and diluted and the paid drinks were the opposite But hey cant complain much about free drinksnnWe had to wait for a couple of groups to arrive before the performances started Amateurs kickoff the night and its up to the ladies to decide if theyre Hunk Mansion material Once thats done the resident performers get on stage The whole time I was expecting bump and grind movements but I gotta give some of these performers props for climbing up 10 foot poles and doing some Cirque du Soleillike tricks If I cant do that then they deserve some of my singles to pay for their college tuition nnFrom what Ive been told the men at Hunk Mansion are more attractive than the performers at other male strip clubs and revues in Vegas There were a few dancers who were on the douchey side and all talk and no game However in general the guys at the club were polite and didnt pressure us into paying for dances Few even came around to ask if we were enjoying the show Staff members even came by to check on everyone and make sure that they were having a great time I cant recall all of their names but my cousins went crazy for Xavier Trey Pitbull Silk and Superman Give those guys moneynnI think Hunk Mansion is an ideal place for a bachelorette party or just to visit with friends who enjoy this particular type of entertainment Im still not a fan but the experience was better than I thought it was going to be It gets my seal of approval Have fun ladies And dont forget to do a Yelp checkin to receive a lightup tiara nnAnd this marks my 400th reviewBar service is great  Drinks never went empty  Dancers are hit and miss  If you are gay not the place  This is aimed towards women and bachelorette parties  Very warm so wear something light  Wouldnt come backThis place is a BLAST I went here for a bachelorette party with a group of girl friends and had an incredible time I honestly couldnt stop thinking about all the lovely men after I left PnnNot only did all of the dancers have AMAZING bodies they were all super cute too And very talented I was so impressed with how they all worked the poles  LOVED the ones hanging from the ceiling They were all ahem super creative with their sexy moves while hanging above the ladiesnnWe paid to have the bride put on stage We spoke to the dancer before she went up and explained shes a little shy and not to go too crazy He did an awesome job of respecting our request  she ended up with a very sensual and impressive dancennI also LOVED how all the dancers had different acts and costumes It made was so entertaining and fun We were all cracking up and giving screams of encouragement the whole night Ive done Thunder Down Under and was disappointed  it was basically a slightly more risque Back Street Boys dance routine Also only one or two brides in the audience actually get special attention EVERYONE who wants some attention at Hunk Mansion gets it Annnnnnd its fantastic DnnAlso the owner Thomas was fantastic He checked in on us throughout the whole night  making sure we were all happy and having a good time He confirmed our reservation via text before we got picked up and kept in communication with me to make sure everything went off without a hitch I wanted to really dazzle the girls with a limo to pick us up so Thomas made sure one was available to get us You can tell he really cares about his customersnnI HIGHLY recommended this for bachelorette parties birthdays or just if you want to have an extra special night with your girl friendsStarted at about a one starwe didnt get into vegas until after 830 which was the last pick up time so we found our own ride herelyft we spoke with people twice saying that was ok getting in was horrible and confusing Having fun inside with the cute guys had brought it back up to a four nNow were trying to use our included ride back and the person isnt responding and the door people are rude as fudgeto be updated laternJust downgraded to one because this is freaking ridiculousDoes Hunk Mansion exist or is it Hustler I chose hunk mansion to avoid the possibility of running into the boys at the bachelor party Luckily the boys were not there since we had to go through the women section to get to the male section The limo driver was very very rude and it was insanely hot in the limo The males at the venue were goodbut not enough variety The view and the actual venue was great thoughand the drink prices were well pricedI owe this place a solid review First time at a male strip club for my bachelorette party weekend We came here Friday night and did a Chippendales show Saturday night Although Chippendales was nice the men at Hunk Mansion are what we all look back on fondly This place is inside of Hustler Club Decently priced drinks nice management and beautiful men A night for the books Highly recommendJust want to say thank you to Thomas for setting up a great night for us Any time we have a special occasion for one of us girls in our group we call Thomas and he tells us the best package to get and sets up our limo transportation and makes sure he has a table reserved for us Hes always helpful and tells you like it is We always leave there having the best time ever I highly recommend this place for all you girls out there wanting to have a good time We cant wait to go backVery fun place I always have a good time when I go to hunk mansion Im surprised to read that someone on here wrote the cowboy is aggressive  He isnt aggressive at all Especially compared to male strippers at other places And he is definitely the hottest guy thereMy friends and I came to check this club out for the first time in July 2013 We paid 45 for the VIP admission which included reserved seats limo pick up and drop off and two drinks The dancers are very friendly and personable and the acts were varied and exciting The guys are very ripped and give you plenty of attention They dont mind if you take pictures either We were treated to shots of tequila so that was pretty cool too When I checked in on yelp they didnt have light up tiaras but they gave me a giant Hustlers cup filled with tons of awesome goodies Theres also a mechanical penis ride which makes for great laughs and photos Hunk Mansion is definitely worth checking out especially for bachelorette parties or anyone wanting some eye candy or more Shout out to the cute bartender and Superman Oh and Thomassuper awesome host that will personally see to it that youre having a good time Amazed by the customer service This was a lot of fun and I cant wait to come backIf I could give this place 10 stars I would First off it was my birthday weekend and where better to spend it than VEGAS My best friend told me she wanted to take me to a strip club my first experience at one and let me just say that I was NOT disappointed For start it was only 30 for a ride to the club admission  2 drinks When I got there I was a little intimidated since I have never been to a strip club before but all I can say is that from the manager nice lady to all the GORGEOUS SEXY BEAUTIFUL men EVERYONE made myself and my girlfriends feel so welcome and comfortable They were not aggressive or rude they were all very kind and sweet and GORGEOUS did I already say that My friend bought me a staged lap dance for 60 with my FAVORITE Maggio oh god that man is just too damn fine I felt a bit nervous being a plus size lady myself to get up on that stage but let me tell you they make you feel so comfortable It was so fun and raunchy  All in all I would highly recommend this place especially if youve never been to a strip club and are a little intimidated    still smilingA great night of fun I went a couple weeks ago with a bachelorette party and had a great time nMy favorite dancer was Guido the Torpedo He did amazing things on the bars  really made me sad that my friend and I were the only ones paying him attention and tipping him nMy favorite personality has to be Maverick hands down He was amusing and talkative and kept coming back for more Those two for sure earned the very last of my dollars nThe cowboy had hung around for a bit but as soon as one of the girls got a lap dance he didnt come back around I know others were thinking of a lap dance at that point so he missed outnThe other guys were great as well but we didnt spend as much time with them nWe had a great time overall and would definitely go back if only to see Guido and Maverick again Next time we will get there earlier Didnt know 10pm was late to arriveBooked hunk mansion after looking at thunder and chippendales Everything I read said to head to hunk mansion All the reviews are right on We had the most amazing time From the limo pick up to the second we left it was so fun All the gorgeous men were so nice and not creepy like some places We just had the best time and will be back I recommend this place 1000 times over  Thanks hunk mansion One of out top 10 girls nights outnThomas was funny and helpful and checked on us throughout the night nYes drinks are pricey but the entertainment is worth it nYes the dancers try to sell you dances its their job At no point was anyone pushy and every single one of us had a blastnWe cant wait to visit againAs a first timer I dont think I could have had a better experience My friend and I got this promotion on their website with the limo ride entrance and 2 drink passes Good deal overall The staff was super friendly and the dancers know how to have a good time The only unfortunate thing was just that the place was DEAD We went on a Thursday night and it was just us and around 2 other groups The company just need to work on promoting themselves and get more people to go because it was a lot of fun nnAdditionally I dont think people clean the limos well Since it was dark in the limo I just sat down and there was water on the seat I left the limo with sad water stain on my dress nnAlso ladies please bring enough money for the dancers I know we can be cheap asses but cmon how can u go to these places and not tip Overall you need to come and experience this I will definitely visit again Thank you hunk mansion for all the laughsmy oh my best male strip club in vegas service ride back and forth was awesome The guys were awesome cant wait to go back againHad my bachelorette party in February  honestly was a bit disappointed The place looks NOTHING like the pictures We showed up  the place was empty Weird to think since it was on a Saturday One of the dancers was being rude to one of my girlfriends  thought that was very unprofessional They only had about 4 dancers the whole night so we kept seeing the same show over  over again Overall we wont be going backI was totally underwhelmed There wasnt anything sensual about the way the guys were dancing It was just a series of tricks I could see any dancer do in the subway I couldnt get anyones attention for a drink Apparently the dancers wont give lap dances to guyswhat is this 1992 Homophobic much We left having blown 70 dollars for nothingHands down the most fun experience youll have in Vegas with a group of girls especially a bachelorette or birthday party Why should guys be the only ones to have all the fun at strip clubs The dancers here are not only handsome but sweet you can tell they are also having a blast The on stage dances are awesome and youll feel like youre watching Magic Mike Heres a tip its worth it to pay for the bachelorette or birthday girl to get an on stage dance The pictures will be amazingOur group of 9 went in for a bachelorette party and had booked one of the bachelorette packages  While we had a GREAT time and the men were hot sexy and super fun we had an unfortunate experience with a dance ticket and getting hustled  The dancers only make money from tips or private and onstage dances this is what the dance ticket is for and they are smooth talkers  Understandably so  Our party had a fun experience after a rough start which is why I gave three stars instead of four  Would recommend with a heads upWe had a great time at Hunk Mansion The guys are amazing and very handsome They did not disappoint at all and men were available all over the stage and floorWe were in Vegas for my daughters 21st Birthday I booked The 50 pp deal off their website which included pick up  drop and 2 drink tickets Our driver TJ was timely and fun on both pick up  drop off The dancers were great and good looking My daughter had a ball We even got her a lap dance Only negative was we werent told the drink tickets expire after a hour but a quick convo with the manager and he gave us new tickets We had the best time everNot to impressed  The dancers are very pushy and money hungry I understand they are there to make money but to stand around talking shit about the other dancers and saying how they are better was a huge turn off Felt like we were dealing with high school boys  We left within 2 hours of being there  I never thought I would say this but Chippendales was alot more funCame with the girls a few weeks ago as my friend was getting married  Club was very nice and the lady that seated us couldnt be more accommodating  Place was clean and the dj played a good mixnWe were all feeling pretty good and maybe the bride a little too good lol  I got her a lap dance with Romeo  He seemed like a nice guy  What was very disturbing to me was that the bride was a little drunk and I saw that Romeo was taking advantage of her  He had his hand all the way up her dress which was very upsetting and them I saw him grab her hand and but it on his privatewhich he pulled out  nThis was so inappropriate and I felt he totally took advantage of her nI think it is fine to have fun but when someone crosses the line that is going way to farnClub is nice if you stay away from himThe best night of my life Went here for my bachelorette party and had the best time Went with a group of 9 girls and we spent the entire night laughing by the end of the night some of us lost our voices This was the highlight of our trip and I highly recommend other bachelorettes coming here The guys dont pressure you if you are shy they will let you sit back and watch until you get into it and trust me you will get into it It was like magic mike i was in heaven My girls paid for me to go on stage and I couldnt stop laughing the entire time The rest of the trip me and my girls would say can we go back to hunk mansion yetCame in on Friday night for one of my besties bachelorette party and we all left with a huge smile on our faces It was all of our first male strip club experience and they showed us the time of our lives  My gf enjoyed her lap dances on stage and all the guys were good looking We got the 300 bachelorette party package deal and it included a party bus to pick us up and back lap dance on stage light up tiara champagne and 2 cocktails each person mandatory you pay at the entrance I will definitely come back on special gno events Thanks Hunk Mansion for showing us girls an awesome timeIve been pondering this review for some time I dont want it to in any way convince others not to go to Hunk Mansion as I think its just not my personal cup of tea especially considering all the other 5 stars   nnAfter doing some heavy yelp research I settled on Hunk Mansion for my best friends bachelorette party  Personally I had never been to a male strip club no there isnt real nudity here they stay in thongs but the reviews were great and riding the mechanical penis sounded like it was right up our alley   We saw on the website that 25 would get you a ride to and from 2 drink tickets and entry  We called around 11pm after our initial contact on the contact form was ignored and a limo driver showed up right on time at midnight as we had asked  The driver was awesome friendly and allowed us to take many a drunken photo in front of the limo  the limo itself was a bit old but nothing worth complaining about  Once dropped off he told us he would be our ride back to the hotel whenever we were readynnInside I checked in on yelp both cashiers looked confused when I mentioned the yelp check in offer the light up tiara and eventually decided who ever was in charge of that wasnt there that evening it was a Sunday  Strike one but whatever  Then we were told the price was 30 something a person  I told them the website had said 25  They then said the price was 28 a person and then dropped it lower to 25  Anyways I was a bit annoyed but still enjoying the fun  nnWe walked straight to the back bypassing the female dancer area and stopped at the area to get dollar bills  Service here was much slower than any other strip club Ive ever been to   Some of the girls stopped at the bar here too this was insanely slow and to top it off the mechanical penis was broken nnContinuing on we ended up in the male dancer section  It was empty perhaps due to it being so late on a Sunday night   It seemed weird to me that there wasnt a guy on stage at all times but this may be due to the fact that there were only about 4 guys  The guys came over and like the other reviewers mentioned they tried to take time to talk to us nice I guess but didnt interest me much  Plus I felt as though they were desperately begging for money  after about an hour we finally ditched the guys and had a much better time watching the female strippers do some incredible pole climbing tricksnnAll in all it was an ok night ended badly when we had to get a taxi back to our hotel though  apparently our driver was busy driving someone else for an hour  The party also spent some time in the Hustler store connected to the club which was funI have been to both female and male strip clubs in Vegas And Ive got to say that these guys are actually great and pretty talented Them moves are better than the girls whaat hahannCame here awhile back with couple of friends I loved that they picked us up with a limo However I didnt like the attitude of the limo driver He was grumpy and complained about picking up girls etc nnAnyways the place itself was well maintained and had a very friendly and helpful host as well as a bartender A cute bartender nnIf you are crazy and want to dive into it I suggest sitting in the front If you want to just watch I suggest sitting in the backnnOverall it was a great experience and definitely a place to try if you are out with your girls But keep your girlfriends away from emotionally attaching to the guys Ive seen it happen Dont do it nnOnly negative comment I have for this place is that the strippers seemed too desperate for money I am not exaggerating when I say that No means no If I dont want a dance from you But the guys kept trying too hard to sell themselves  and even said I am just trying to make money here you know This is my job Well what a turn off It wasnt like I was not going to buy any lap dances I ended up buying a lap dance for a friend from a different guy I think he was the superman He didnt pressure us into anything at all and made sure my friend was comfortable which was nice nnPlease dont pressure the customers too much Otherwise its a byefeliciaSold Me and my best friend decided we needed a little good clean fun  Having never been to a male strip club before  we hoped on yelp and started looking Hunk Mansion had great reviews compared to every other place we came across  We called the club for more info We were treated great right off the bat  So  we decided to give it a go nThe club sent a white stretch limo to our hotel for pick up Us two girls had the whole limo to ourselves where we pregamed and prepared for the night ahead The Limo was freewe tipped the driver well we payed a 25 cover that included two free drinks from their fully stocked bar nAll the employees were friendly the club was clean and nicely set up the male club is a small section of the over all huge Hustler club store nWhat a blast Most of the men were tall buff and ready to please with the exception of a few smaller boy like men  but Ehh everyones tastes are different The bartender was an absolute Hunk nThe men not only do a fantastic job dancing and working the stage  but they are very sensual and hands on with us ladies Love Logan nOverall A Fantastic night Were both hooked and will definetly be spending a lot of time here seeing as were frequent LA to LV weekenders nIt was obvious that all the women were loving it It was great fun encouraging and cheering on the other ladies in the joint We all bonded over the joys of naked men  theres even times where all the women are encouraged to hop on stage to dance and work the poles nOverall best experience I could have dreamed of Not a disappointing moment all night nIf you cant beat em  join emn We will forever be Regulars to the male strip club scene nThank you Hunk Mansion for an exceptional nightWhere do I even beginnnQuick note for those of you that dont want to read everything I am writing just know that EVERYTHING THEY ADVERTISE IS FALSEnnFirst off Hunk Mansion is really Hustlers Honestly this place was not what was advertised nnFrom the beginning the driver was 50 minutes late to pick us up from our hotel The website said first come first serve We did not want to be late and miss out on our table The driver said to us Dont worry theres only 5 drivers and we are all running behind If you where ready then you should have called me to get you sooner Wish this would have been communicated to me sooner Once the driver picked us up he was honestly an awesome man I would give Raul 5 stars alone He gave me his own card and told me to call him 30 minutes before I needed to be picked up and he was right on time for pick up Raul really made up for being late nnArriving We went in through a side elevatorREALLY SKETCHY The bouncer was really sketchy also The bouncer mentions the 1st and 2nd floor where girl strippers and the top floor was mennnRight when we sat down we where bombarded with men asking us for dances Honestly I know you need to make your money but give us a second to put our stuff down and get our drinks You would make better money if you make things about the Customers nnI previously paid for a bottle service online through the Hunk Mansion Website I had to ask for our bottle 4  times before I was told to go walk up to the manager up front Fine I did so We finally receive our bottle and glasses Cheap bottle AND ALL THE WINE GLASSES STILL HAD LIPSTICK ALLLLLL OVER THEM I did not drink my Champagne in fear that I would get something from the Fing glass This is not SANITARY We had to ask for new glassesnnNext Online advertised a 60 Cash Dance on stage of a Dancer You Want and Pay Him Direct This was not the case I had to walk up front to pay some guy and find out that the dance is no longer 60 My manager changed it last week to 75 I told them that I saw the add for 60 and asked if they could honor that The said No 75 or nothing Fine Gave them the 75 and said I know what guys my sister wants a dance from The add says she gets to pick the dancer They said No she doesnt get to pick We where also promised a Tiara for The bride but we never received that Everything they advertised was FALSE   I will attach pictures of what was advertised nnHonestly I did everything I could to just get my sister drunk so she wouldnt pay attention to the little things nnSide note The dancers here were really good but extremely aggressive nnI could go on and on about this place but I will leave it at that I hope everyone else has better experiencesWent with a couple of friends last week and had a blast For 30 we got a free limo ride to the club entry and 2 drinks For some reason most of the male strip clubs are only open on FridaySaturday but Hunk Mansion opens on Thursdays The guys are cool not creepy and gross at all and you will have a great time I will definitely be back next time Im in Vegas They also have a luggage room in case you wanna make a quick stop on your way to the airport lolCame here for my sisters bachelorette party and we had a pretty good time It was also our first time at a male stripclub so we really didnt know what to expectnnIf this is your first time going to a male stripclub heres a few things about this placenn1 No photography  for reasons Im unsure of they have a VERY strict no camera policy The DJ WILL call you out if they see your phone out My sister the bride  who just so happen to have her phone in her hands while one of the performers were dancing on her  got her phone taken away by the stripper himself AND  WAIT FOR IT  he dropped it down his crotch panties hahahahaha The funniest part and totally unrelated is my sis is also a germaphobe so that was a treat in itself just seeing her cringe haha But again this might not be something other ladies will find humorous but do respect the house rules  no photosvideosnn2 THEY HUSTLE  these gentlemen DO live up to their name Within 5 minutes of arriving we had quite a few men coming up to us offering lap dances for 25 Now I get it thats yo job you do this stuff but they definitely dont beat around the bush At some point I felt like carcass being circled by vultures And hey some people like to get straight to the lap dance I personally would have liked to get settled at our table first But they do put on a show They may come at you fast but they do very good jobnn3 Getting the bride on stage  60 something cash or 72ish something on card Needless to say I had already spent all my cash on the performers so had to put this on the card ahhhnn4 Maid of Honors  theyll target you too just watchnn5 They are definitely handsy  I came to this club thinking YOU the lady would be putting your hands on THEM But oh no they touch you too Not in a creepy molesting kind of way but they do incorporate you in their dances like a plaything Just something to think about if youre not comfortable with thatnn6 They are accommodating  our bridal party pitched in to put the bride and a bridesmaid on stage for a special dance I requested earlier that they go a little easier on my sister since shes a bit more conservative and  they were more than happy to oblige It was hilarious seeing the bride and her bridesmaid side by side getting lapdances of different caliber from the same mannnAll in all  we had a good time Cant share the stories to my friends enough At least next time Ill be better preparedGreat venue for bachelorette party Great variety of men so there was eye candy for everyone We had so much fun If your celebrating an event pay to get the lucky girl on stage It is TOTALLY worth it Our bride to be had a great time Thank you to all the hunks at Hunk MansionHunk Mansion was great Small intimate room clean and great guys The guys were hot as well as total sweethearts A couple of them were a little pushy trying to get you to buy lap dances etc But its their job and how they make their money so I understand  It was my daughters 21st birthday and they were all really attentive We paid the extra for her to get a special dance up on the stage and we werent disappointed Drinks were good bartender was great too We stayed for almost 5 hoursit was a blast Id highly recommend it to anyone wanting to let loose and have some fun Limo service was great too Not really any complaints In our group was a woman in her 60s 1 in her 50s 2 in their 40s and 1 21 yr old and we all had an amazing time If ever in Vegas again i will most certainly go to Hunk MansionHad a blast for bachelorette party will be coming back to see phoenix he was my favorite one  Im in love lol I really didnt want to go but I ended up loving the place Unfortunately after seeing these sexy men regular guys seem unattractive I highly recommendGood looking dancer  Exceptional car service to and from our location  Thomas makes sure to make everything just rightMy girls and I went here for my bachelorette party night My maid of honor called ahead and had a limo pick us up The limo driver and party bus were clean on time and a blast When we arrived Landon immediately greeted our group and gave us first class treatment Giving me my light up tiara and checking on us all night  We felt special right from the start  The guys knew how to keep the party going and knew their business Very impressed It was an unforgettable night with top notch service men and dancing I will also add that the women of hustler were top notch as well Thank you Landon and staff for the amazing service that is so rare in this day in age You and the staff care about customer service and it shows in everything you offer at your club nWe highly recommend this club  I would post pictures of how my time here went but then I would probably never be able to apply for jobs again Since anything goes in Vegas we decided to come here at the very early hour of 730 since we had a busy night ahead of us The call to make an appointment was easy and pleasant and the limo arrived exactly at 730 to whisk us away to man paradise nnEveryone there was SUPER nice and accomodating Because the majority of people in Vegas were probably still sleeping off their hangovers at 730 we were the first people there and got to sit front row Score Not only did we get two nice strong drinks and transportation for 25 but we also got a free shooters upon arrival I suggest that all of you use this as the place to pregame before going anywhere else because drink prices are probably the most reasonable in all of VegasIf you tip the driver well both ways he will definitely also drive you back to your hotel after the shownnAs for the men they were all super nice and conversational while we waited for them to get on stage I felt like we were almost at some networking event or something but with less clothing and more props The show was for lack of better words less of a show and more of a literally handson experience which all 7 of us thought was great Naturally my friends decided to surprise me with a stage show for my birthday but lets be real it was more of a gift of entertainment for themselves in which the cowboy and I apparently put on quite the show for the audience I dont think I closed my mouth once during the performance mind out of the gutter people it was obviously from surprise and laughterBest male strip club in Las Vegas  Came here for my best friends bachelorette party  Hot guys cheap drinks and round trip limo just to name a few things as to why I love this place  They have a 6 penis ride Make sure your bachelorette wears something that lets her give it a shot our bride had pencil skirt on and had to miss out Great customer service they really made us feel special and gave the bachelorette tons of attention   Thomas was amazing for dealing with all the changes I had to make to the reservation youre a SAINT  Definitely will make sure the next bachelorette party I go to in Vegas will be hereI had my first experience at Hunk Mansion just a few days ago for my cousins bachelorette party We had such a good time  we all had a good experience there The manager Karin was very nice  made sure we all were having a good time  were enjoying ourselves The guys were all really nice especially Maggio plus the two bartenders as well The facility was very clean  was a nice place nMy only complaint was that a few of the guys were a little pushing for their private dances But overall it is a great place to gonOne highlight of the night was seeing Andy Dick when we arrived having him take a picture with my cousin who was the bachelorettePerfect place to go for a bachelorette party Much more personalized experience than shows you can go to on the strip Management was very helpful when a person in our party thought she lost her purse we found itphew I will be recommending this place to any ladies I know who are going to Vegas and I cant wait to go back myselfCame here with my best friend to experience a male strip club for the first time All I can say is TAKE ME BACK We had an absolute BLAST The only thing I regret is losing the bartenders number snaps fingers Damn It was such an awesome crowd and the dancers were on point Looking forward to our next visitWe went to this place to celebrate my friends bachelorette part All of us are first timers we spent a wonderful and unforgettable night at this here   This is a must go place in Vegas for all girls All the male strippers are very cute and dance professionally loved their performance As first timers we dont have experience so I would suggest you to bring more CASH Then your night will even betterThis place is perfect for a girls night out or bachelorette party They guys are all smoking hot and really friendly and fun They want the girls in their club to have a good time This place was clean and well maintained  I would absolutely go backAbsolutely  LOVE this place  We are here now  Was a little leary after somereviews on here but DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINTED  Not too crowded but a good  crowd  The men are AWESOME  Some may not be  my style but  definitely  put on good show  Had an awesome time and very glad we chose Hunk Mansion over the other places  All the staff are amazing too  Will definitely  come back  next time in town  Highly recommend  Cant wait to come back Ive visited here 3 times in the last few months Each time my experience was better I drove to Vegas from Reno On my first trip down Thomas was great on the phone as we were running late He said pedal to the metal but be safe Our driver was wonderful Arriving at the club we were greeted by Karin who went out of her way to make us feel important DjJosh was great at making us blush I was approached by Guido and this guy has moves Not only on stage but his lap dance was youza He made the night  incredible and memorable for menSecond trip I follow hunk mansion on  twitter facebook and Instagram too I tried their offer of texting for a package and wow Was not expecting the great offer Our limo showed up promptly The second time around the staff was great at remembering me DjJosh was giving me shout outs and Guido had me in the biggest hug ever Enjoyed my lap dances once again with Guido and got my first lap dance with Maggio Great timenThird trip I used the same texting deal and Tenya was great Arrived yet again to have my two favorites there Guido and MaggionLadies if you prefer lots of attention I suggest you go on a Thursday night Its not packed as a Friday or Saturday The guys really give you 1 on 1 time nI want to thank Thomas Karin Tenya DjJosh and especially Guido and Maggio nCouldnt get there for my birthday yesterday but will be there soon for my belated WIGGLE Thanks Midnite</td>\n","    </tr>\n","

arrived around 730pm and were seated after a short wait  After browsing the menu and a brief discussion with our waiter we ordered seafood noodles and a 3 item mix meat plate BBQ pork chicken and ducknnThe food came soon thereafter and it was hot and delicious  There was large portions and lots of seafood in the seafood noodles and the mix meat plate came with good cuts of meat and the correct saucesnnAfter the meal we received fortune cookies for dessertnnnFoodnThe food was good quality  Ingredients tasted fresh and dishes tasted well made  Food is above average but nothing stood out even though I was quite hungrynnPricenPrice is high in comparative to other Chinese cuisine and comparable to large western restaurant chainsnnServicenThe service is average to slightly below average  A common malaise of chinese restaurants is poor service where the waiterwaitresses are overworked impatient unattentive  Emerald Chinese is no exception  The waiting staff at the restaurant appear rushed and impatient  All our services needs were met but the staff was rushed and grumpynnDecornEmerald has tasteful decorations comfortable chairs and nice tablecloths  There is sufficient room to navigate between tablesnnnOverall we had a good meal with large portions received average service and paid slightly more than we had hoped for our mealnn31  50Weve always been there on a Sunday so we were hoping that Saturday dim sum would be less busy No such luck We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed I could understand if it was empty and the carts werent circulating but every table was full It took a while to get drinks and other items napkins The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits but they were acceptableNo automatic doors not baby friendly I frequent this Chinese restaurant before and post partum Dim sum is ok dishes at dinner time are huge service is great BUT there are no automatic doors How am in supposed to push my stroller insideHorrible servicenI went there tonight with my boyfriend because hes passed by the place a couple of times and we wanted to try it out We orders bok choy chicken fried rice and some lemon chicken When we got our food the chicken was hard and looked old like it had been refried So i complained to the server he didnt even acknowledge my complaint and just left i told another server and he told me that  this is how they make it and left without even offering to provide a new one Finally a women server offered to get a new one and even agreed with us that it was old But it took about 20 minutes and all we had was the rice and bok choy By the time they brought it out we just werent hungry anymore considering we did not want to eat the chicken by itself and our rice was already cold Only exception is the sweet older lady who served us the rest of servers were rude One server even went to the table beside us to check the bill to see how much tip a couple had gave after they left We heard him mention tip as he looked at the bill and threw it back down angry Disgusting will not returnOne of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patronsnnMy wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch 900 AM  1100 AM on weekends The food is great the place is clean and there is ample parking around the restaurant From within the restaurant you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do notnnThe ideal time to come on weekends is between 1000 AM and 1100 AM Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet Come after 11 AM expect to fall in line nnThe staff is efficient but do not expect a lengthy conversation For a place like this this is not a put down Its what I expectnnThe quality of the dim sum is comparable to what youd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts The turnaround is pretty quick a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables so very seldom is the food going around for too long My personal favorites are the sweet pork  served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry chicken feet shrimp  served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap pork and century egg congee and the douhua silken tofu with syrup My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodlesnnThere may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you then this place is difficult to beatIve been a frequent at this place for years enough that the managers pretty much recognize my whole family And I have to say this is probably my favorite Chinese place for lunchnnFirst of all the place is HUGE My relatives have booked this place as a venue for weddings events gatherings and we usually get a good experience On some days when you come at a busy time its not that bad of a wait because of how many tables there are I remember waiting in a line past the door a few times to be seated but maybe this has changednnFOOD I honestly think its great here though it is a bit expensive for what it offers I prefer the lunch dim sum letting them wheel carts as you take your pick Its nice because Im definitely not a decisive person so I usually just get the tastiest looking stuff on the carts A favorite is the crap shrimp ball things  lol the siu mai dumplings theyre all very good I also love the green vegetable plates or the scallops here theyre cooked well and Ive never had any rubbery or overcooked meatnnSERVICE is all pretty good too imo a lot of the cart ladies speak broken English and a bit of a Vietnamese so its not too hard for us Theyre usually fast too bringing drinkssaucesplates when we ask right away nnnnI would definitely recommend this place to people The reason its a 4 is because I find the dinner experience to be a bit disappointing often our dishes are just warm or sometimes cool when we order them However I love coming back at lunch I think the dim sum is a fun and tasty experience Actually I go almost every week and Ive not noticed any drop in quality so this place will probably remain my goto Chinese lunch for nowWe chose this restaurant for our Chinese New Year dinner The menu has a wide variety of dishes The service was par We order the pre fix menu and some side dishes  The waiter was at first not acoomendating but after a discussion with my dad they agreed on what we asked for The food was mediocre to good Most dishes were hot and tasty besides a few that were a bit salty Overall the experience was goodI went at 230 on a Monday It was dimsum nnI hated every second I was there the carts were going around but the ladies kept ignoring us and I dont understand why nnwe got gar how  a spinach dumpling nnAfter that not a single cart were go by and we sat for so long till I finally I gave up nnwe went to pay and it was 14 which is soooo high for what we got  nnIll never ever go back nn food was good thoughMy family and I were at Emerald yesterday during the busiest point of dim sum traffic All I can say is it is total mayhem There werent any lines during the time we were there but I believe that is because they churn through customers in a manner I have never seen before The tables are smooshed together to get as many in and out quickly I cant really blame them I get it When you have a good thing capitalize on it Though this atmosphere creates a bit of a frantic assembly line feel that I dont particularly find enjoyablennThere is no denying that the food at Emerald is pretty good When it comes to dim sum they stand out among the rest as they offer way more options than any other restaurant Their offerings are unique and plentiful in size but not in overall temperature of dish Only 1 of the dishes we received were actually the temperature it needed to be Again a symptom of the style of restaurant nnService was perfunctory at best Cart servers were like street corner merchants hawking their wares Actually placing items on the table while explaining why you simply needed to have it in as few words as possiblennOverall 3 stars is being a little more generous than I should be But the food is actually not badBecause we are in Mississauga I think this place is pretty good compare to other dim sum places around the area Me and my family used to come here a lot but nowadays we all so busy that we come here lessnnThe dim sums here arent as fancy as the one in Mississauga China Town but I dont mind the look I just mind about the tastennTips only a few dim sum need to order Most of them are pushed outWhenever I go here on the weekend this place is super busy  Expect to wait about 30 minutes for a table  This place is also mutliethnic  You will see people of all different races coming here  This place is one of the chinese dim sum restaurants that white people like to come to  nnThe food is decent but it is pricey  You can find much cheaper dim sum places elsewhere but if you dont speak chinese you will be more comfortable coming here nnSometimes depending on what time you come here there will be barely any food coming around nnDerekCame on a weekday morning with bf to avoid the weekend crowds and we definitely enjoyed our experience herennFood 55nOrdered a bunch our staples lotus leaf wrapped sausage and sticky rice preserved egg congee egg yolk bun And they were all pretty bombnEmployees were walking around with carts full of dim sums Super Cantonese stylenSome items in the cart are off the menunnService 55nSuper friendly and funny staffsWilling to explain everything despite the language barriernnEnvironment 35nBit outdatednLobby and washroom are particularly sketchynnOverall 45 will returnnAnd we were told on weekends there are a more variety of dim sumsDespite the poor service here my family comes here for special occasions because the quality of their dishes is pretty decent There is a wide variety of dishes and you can also order a 10course meal if youd like The dim sum menu is also very selectivennBut as mentioned the service is terrible Youll expect to wait 2030 mins for your food especially if you come with a large group I know you cant expect good service from an asian restaurant but Im used to the quick eat in and out type of meal and its definitely subpar service here The waiters are also not very friendly and give you attitude when you ask when your food is comingnnI only give this restaurant 2 stars because the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the qualityselection of food is goodThe dimsum here is actually alright Food was good relative to its price Servers were nice despite language barriers Nicely lit and seemingly tidyclean environment with beautiful decor Wasnt the best dimsum Ive tasted but it was goodThis is one of the few bigger chinese restaurants in mississauga They have solid good food Although in recent visits the service has been lacking nMy family and I always come here for birthdays holiday and recently Chinese New Year dinner nnIn those few times the service of our food has taken a very long time The food does not arrive until 2030 minutes after ordering Not only that but they did not provide the starter soup nnWhen we question the servers about the wait time we received some lip It was only when the managers came to serve us the service was a bit better nnEmerald overall is a great restaurant but next time we might take our family business elsewhereWe have been going here to eat for years whether it is a celebration or just a regular night out for dinnernI always continue to go here yes the service isnt that great but I wont complain about the service the place is always extremely busy and I think that speaks for itselffood never disappoints dim sum delivery fresh authentic Chinese foodGood dim sum not too expensive out in Mississauga but worth the trip nnOur family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger varietynnI think its consistently good not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasnt a wait because that meant the food usually sat around Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants nnIm giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto its usually the place I think of first But really maybe it should be 35nnNot sure about the service or nondim sum menu so this review is just for dim sumnnI like anything with bbq pork especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle and baked bbq pork buns I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce wrapped sticky rice Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessertnnNot sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so Im describing the dishes sorry but if youve been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out Next time I go Ill try to update the namesTraditional and authentic Dim Sum I couldnt believe I walked in a 3pm on a weekday and there were carts full of dim sum Lots to choose from and new dumplings I never tried Mighty impressed by taste but when the bill came I was shocked 30 for 5 items Ah well ya live once Im going backPoor service overpriced food  Make sure to check your dim sum bill  They tried cheating me and making things more expensive  Very dishonest business and would not go backThis is the second time Ive ever been here and I was quickly reminded why I didnt come back after the first time I came on a weekend after the lunch rush so the restaurant wasnt busy at all Most of the dim sum I ordered I noticed was just pulled from a sitting cart so it needed to be warmed up  I believe they had to microwave it The food is normal You can get the same taste and quality type food at other dim sum restaurants and pay literally half the price Some dim sum items are 6 a plate which I dont think is justifiable at all when I can get the same dish and portion size elsewhere for half the cost I almost fell off my chair when my 70 bill for 2 people arrived at the table I wont be returning here and wouldnt recommend my friends to go here Its way overpricedFood is really good the place is super busy during the weekend I love it Remembers me China nnBut I find the price too high for what it is I still highly recommend this placeWe saw that the rating was not that high but decided to stop by anyways A lot of Chinese restaurants with great food but poor service often suffer on yelp ratings but the food here was not good enough to balance out the bad servicennWe got there at around noon on a weekday and it was pretty full It took a few minutes for someone to seat us We ordered some dishes from the carts but realized we had no utensils It took about ten minutes for us to wave someone over to bring us some Although the guy who seated us asked us what tea we wanted he never brought it by and it took another ten or so minutes for us to get someones attentionnnWe got beef changfen shrimp dumplings spinach moon dumplings curry octopus and meatballs The skin on the dumplings and changfen was soft but too thick for the amount of filling inside The meatballs were flavorful but not very tender Only the octopus had both flavor and textureMy family15 ppl and I came yesterday to celebrate a baptism and my birthday We got there and the reservation was under my uncles name and they already choosed and paid for the dishes they selected for each table  The waitress was badgering us appetizerssoups but we didnt know that it was extra most of it didnt taste really good especially the tripeliver which made me gagThe basic Chinese food like the sizzling beef mushrooms chow mein was really good though However the lack of customer service pissed me off My relative was going to pay but the amount of money they charged was crazy and they added dishes we didnt even have the manager literally got up in my uncles face yelling at him and his wife and made her cry by telling them that theyre going to call the police That is not how you treat a customer  We are never going back because of how we were treated Overall the food gets a 35 and customer service gets 25 I hope they dont treat other customers like thatI would say Emeralds has worsen over a period of few months honestly the service here was never the greatest but now it has gotten to the point where the employees barely know any english nnAlso they served us with dumplings that have gone bad and were very sour in taste  Meh I wouldnt really care however they charged us for it So I have to pay to eat dumplings that may prove to be a health concern  nnAt least the washrooms were clean PThe dim sum here is really good  There was a huge lineup on Sunday  There was alot of variety  More than many other dim sum restaurants  if you are close to the airport this will be a great place to go for dim sum in Mississauga  Its only about 20min from the Toronto airport  There is not alot of push carts left in the Toronto area  Their prices are reasonable  Four people can be really full on 50 for lunch  nnI used to live in Mississauga and this was one of the better restaurants in the area  If its a weekend youll have to wait at least half an hour at lunch  If you only have 2 people you might get a table right away  They have a few 2 people table that no one uses  Most people come here in groups of 4 or moreIve been here a quite a few times over the last two or three years and something has definitely changed The quality of the food has gone down hill and the prices are ridiculous nnToday I went with my husband for lunch and we were disappointed The food was cold and on four occasions after we ordered the dim sum the woman said okay let me warm it up for you and proceeded to the back to microwave it What the heck Why are they pushing around cold dishesnnWhen we asked for shrimp rice rolls the waiter put in the order to the kitchen  we thought great at least it will be fresh Well when they came out we wanted to send it back The roll was gummy and falling apart Not pleasant at all nn40 for seven dishes four of them microwaved one of them barely edible  just not a good meal Should have gone to Manchu WokI usually come here when nothing else is open especially during holidays It takes forever to get your food especially take out I usally get there seafood and beef fried rice Nothing special Service isnt that great either but its the only place open during xmas and new years lolI usually really like the dim sum here but my lunch here yesterday was a real letdown We came right before 2pm so maybe the timing something to do with it but Im told their dim sum is on till 4pmnnThe har gow was the worst Ive ever had and I rarely get to say that about har gow The shrimp was tiny rubbery and it tasted off I was just glad we didnt get sick off it It tasted completely different from how they used to do it here so Im not sure if they used a bad batch but if so it shouldnt have been served in the first place Another staple the shiu mai was also pretty bad It was tasty usually but it was tiny and Im not sure if it had any fish egg topping either If it did it wasnt noticeable The shiu mai here used to be huge but it seems the owner is shrinking it every single year Even the bbq pork rice roll was disappointing there were tiny slivers of bbq pork in it We also ordered some fried pork  veggie dumpling that was actually served to us cold The lady pushing the cart never bothered to heat it back up for us I guess Stuff like this should be basic The only dishes I liked were the steamed choy sum with oyster sauce The xiao long bao was also decentnnOverall it seems like theyre skimping on everything that costs money now Despite that prices are higher than other dim sum spots Thats not a good combination I hope the owner recognizes this soon because itd be a shame for one of the few good dim sum spots in the city to keep on this pathFood was awesome but the service was horrible I felt like I had to hunt someone down to order items Might try one more time due to the food being deliciousThis is THE place for Dim Sum in Mississauga Dont despair if you see a huge line up at the door on weekends things move quickly There is no rhyme or reason to the hostess numbering systemso just wait your turn knowing that it is going to be great food The food is cooked in steamer baskets and walked around the restaurant on carts Someone at your table has to take the key ordering position so as to flag down the cart and get the food on the table The food runs out quickly so dont wait for it to come around again it may be a while or never They do a great job with the staple DS fare Har gow shrimp dumplings Shui Mai pork and sticky rice My personal favourite is the scallops with garlic sauce Try the Chinese greens dumpling soup and pork sesame seed buns The spring rolls  with meat filling are awesome as wellnThe best time to go is just before noon on weekends or on weekdays Anytime after 200 pm is pointless as they will be out of most food itemsthis place is the best place to get dim sum  the food is delicious and the staff is always welcoming and attentive to our needs the only thing im not crazy about it the washrooms and anyone who knows me knows I like to see how clean a place is based on the cleanliness of their bathroomsthe service in this place is poooor hands down as is the case with most chinese restaurants  but the food is good and well priced if u can handle lack of service but good food this place is for you went there for dinner and it wasnt that busy but the service was but food was good and well sized portionsThis is your standard dim sum however its a bit more expensive than other dim sum locations in the area Overall a good experience and would recommend to try out Had their 11 course menu and the food was all very tasty and cooked well There is a great bubble tea store next door tooI used to work in Oakville if coworkers and I wanted dim sum this is the only place thats reasonably close AND offers decent food nnMy Dim Sum SSQSW nnServe Style  push cart I would have preferred ordering from a menu but coworkers who arent dim sum regulars like the pushcart style so they can peek before ordering nnSelection  good aplenty on seafood dishes steamed shrimp dumpling steamed shrimp with chives dumpling fried shrimp dumpling fried shrimp with chives dumpling  you get the gist They have all the usual suspects for dim sum nnQuality  okay Because its always busy weve not had unfresh food nnService  so so I think they try to be efficient if not warm and attentive The servers are always in such a rush whos got time to smile at or chat with you If you want something just be assertive and flag someone down in a polite way nnWait Time  avoid 1145  1245 peak lunch time Otherwise finding a parking and getting a table will taste your patienceIm writing this update based on the lunch I had here today nnIm so annoyed that the service is so incredibly rude I can understand that they might be busy and need to move fast Sometimes they respond to me but they look the other way Im okay with that too nnBut today we went and I would ask people for tea and cutlery and things and they would put a grump face and storm away only to come back with the minimal amount of things nnI mean we asked for hot sauce and he just  violently squeezed hot sauce in everyones bowls I was shocked and then so I asked for more bowls And he stomped off and brought me just one bowl What about everyone elsennSome other servers are quite nice If you need anything try to flag down the guy in the suittie or the ladies in the black blazers Anyone else will just throw things at you figurativelynnThey also again tried to put stuff on our table and I had to tell them to take it back When she was confused what i wanted I got yelled at nnI think if you are a regular and they get to know you the service would be better It would be the managers serving you not the others nnNonetheless the place is always packed full of the local asian folk which is a good thing I can understand why its cheap and the food is quite decent they can cook the short ribs a bit more  This time with 5 people we paid 11 a person nnIf it wasnt for the only dim sum place in proximity and my coworkers loving it so much I wouldnt come back nI really dont need to be treated like a 2nd class citizenYears ago they were great  Not much of a fan of their food anymore  I dont go for dim sum but rather actual dinners  Havent been impressed with their cost as it seems to be rising despite being busier than I can ever rememberWe ordered the duck It looked and tasted like fried plastic I had a watery bowel movement 30 min after leaving the restaurant My stomach did not like it either I have decided I will only eat Mandarin restaurant Chinese food from now on I do not think I can handle authentic Chinese food because it is disgusting and poor quality meat Lots of tiny bones in the meat by the way I felt like I was eating scraps fed to dogs  and I paid to experience thisnnNoodles I did not tryThis was terrible I was forced to go there on a team event at work and it was quite awful A bunch of people walking around in carts and you holler at them better have someone who speaks Cantonese with you so they can understand if you want something on the cart they are tagging along I tried some of those foods that the workmates had called up on the table as we were haring the bills and everything from the rice to the chicken to every single thing was terrible Maybe my palette is not open minded enough but the whole design where you call on the waitresses with the carts which I guess is Dim Sum is not my thingI wouldnt come back When they took us here I was hoping it was an average North American Chinese restaurant or at least if they had some common North American Chinese dishes Id be fineit was too traditional in my opinioneither that or the people I went with ordered the food that is so Either way I left hungry and didnt like it at allCame at 11ish AM on a Saturday and didnt really have to wait for a tablennStandard dimsum service Really nothing much else to say Environment is quite nice though for a dimsum place Also its cartserviceMy family has been going here off and of for probably close to 10 years  Im almost certain it has changed owners during that time  Anyhow we generally try not to come here as its not a great Chinese restaurant but its one of the very few Chinese restaurants that can hold a large group  nnWe arrived with a table of 10 and we had reservations  After being confused why we were told we had a 40 minute when we had reservations we finally sat down after talking to the head hostess for 20 minutes  This didnt start off our meal on the right footnnWe choose a smaller banquet meal for 8 and supplemented with a few other dishes since we didnt like the really big banquet dinners  The typical complimentary soup came out and the service was clearly not interested in service  The soup spilled all over the place when it was taken from the serving bowl to the smaller bowls  This behaviour continued throughout the meal  Most dishes were just thrown onto the table while the waiter often just pushed people aside to get to the centre of the table  The only thing that saved the meal were the dishesnnThough they werent outstanding or great all the dishes were fairly well executed  Nothing was greasy oily underseasoned overseasoned or burnt  Steamed fish was fresh and light  Chicken was cooked perfectly and moist  Vegetables were nicely flavoured and still crispy  The lobster could be better it was on the scrawny side and it was hard to find any meat in there  All in all  nothing horrible among the 10 dishes we ordered  nnIn comparison to the east end this restaurant is probably just average but since were in Mississauga it stands to be one of the better ones  Its too bad we dont have a great Mississauga Chinese restaurantVery busy on weekends but definitely more food and cart options then during the weekdays when you wont catch yourself in line Good food the only Dim Sum in Mississauga with Sweet and Sour Pork Feet w Eggs sounds gross but its believed to be very nutrional as the Vinegar in the soup helps purify the bloodUnfortunately there is not many choices for dimsum in mississauga This is our togo place for dimsum We dont go samwoo because we feel like Emerald has more selection than samwoo Food is average some dishes are decent however some are not fresh nnDont ever expect a good service from here They suck at services The waiters waitress sometimes give you an attitude It really depends on their moods to give you a good servicewont be back againnAt most only the coke was good Its the only thing that came at the right temperatureCame here for dimsum on a Sunday with a group of 20  Its just your typical dimsum restaurant and it definitely hit the spot for me  We got around 10 different dishes and everything tasted greatThis is probably the most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Mississauga Largely because of all the 1 star reviews for poor service Despite this the place constantly has line ups for their dim sum so they must be doing something right Ive honestly never had a bad dim sum dish here Har gow beef balls sticky rice lotus leaf rice shiu mai tofu with crab meat congee pig feet etc Everything is great The service is plain spoken and frantic but thats dim sum for you Its certainly not worse than other similar restaurantsWe just walked out of this restaurant and I would give this place zero stars if I could It started out badly from the beginning when a member of my party asked for a fork and the server told them they couldnt have one until after we place an order  which is complete nonsense After the food was ordered we requested hot sauce The servers did not even want to take the time to let us finish our words before they walked away begrudgingly to get the wrong sauce Next the food came it was all lukewarm and mediocre at best Heavily lacking spices and any semblance of flavour Lastly to add insult to injury our bill arrived We watched as all the other tables around us enjoyed their oranges and fortune cookies as their bills arrived that for some reason we were not treated to I guess we didnt qualify for themnnThis is my first review and I felt so compelled by the horrible food and even worst service that i felt it was my duty to warm others Go elsewhere Its one thing to have bad service and good food or vice versa but not both sadly nnWe will not be returningWe used to go here quite a bit for dim sum but lately weve been going elsewhere  Today we found ourselves there for a last minute family dim sum brunch  I was reminded of why we dont really go there anymorenn1  The layout Depending on where you sit you may get hot dim sum fresh off the carts or you may get that cart that has onesies of everything left overwhich implies you may have to wait quite awhile for that one item youve been jonesing for  You could order it too but that can take some time  nn2  The quality  Sometimes its good sometimes its meh  Its rarely excellent nn3  The wait  OMGoodness  On a Sunday morning at noon you can expect a hefty wait especially if youre in a group larger than 4  I dont even attempt Saturday morning  Id have to assume that the rush dies down after 2 pm but dont quote me on thatnnId say its a good place to go if youre a dim sum newb and you like to see the items before you order them  But otherwise there are better options out thereI LOVE dim sum and this place does it RIGHT The dishes are consistently good The only problem might be in dealing with the servers that dont speak English If you look asian and cant speak Cantonese or Mandarin they look at you like you are from another planet But you come for the food and that is the most important This is old school Chinese food at its bestnnIts always busy so if you like a quiet intimate setting then this is not for youBad reception from the hostess We ordered items but were later told some of them are not available We switched but when the bill came it still included the switched items The waiter had to go validatennFood was soso better for post bar consumption nnWashrooms had not been taken care of for at least several hours paper everywhereThis place is a hidden gem in Mississauga  It might look a little rundown on the outside and the foods were absolutely legit and authentic  Dim sum was outstanding my family and I technically had stayed in Toronto for 4 days and we had dim sum over here twice already  Yes it was that good  Presented with a wide variety of dim sum savory and sweet from the steamed buns to baked sago pudding dessert wish I had more room in the stomach  Dinner was not super duper but prices were reasonable and foods were not bad at allHave been there many times for dim sum and was always great First time for dinner and the service was so bad Will not be back nnGlasses were dirty with food stuck on them and fingerprints everywhere Pretty scary nnFelt like it was such a hassle to have us eat there The wait staff constantly reach over you to serve or take away things from the table It was an experience I wont forget anytime soonI have dined a few times for dim sum and dinner  I like their menu as there is traditional Chinese dishes and unique dishesnnThey have set menus for dinner which have a nice variety  The food always taste good but sometimes the service is good and sometimes not so muchnnI would return again as the food keeps me coming backTheir dim sum is a bit pricier compared to other places but their spring rolls have got me hookedThis place has pretty good food iv never had a bad time here Good portions good taste It is a tad pricey tho if i might add I come here all the time so I guess iv gotten used to the pricing They open late almost every night they close at 1 for most nights I think Staff is friendly but most of them dont speak alot of English but theres one who speaks good English tho I just dont like the washrooms or the hallway to the washroom looks sketchy Theres fish tanks with crab and other seafoodalive tho And it right along where people sit down and sometimes the one of the staff comes along and takes a fish out of the tank with a fishnet thats the only thing I dont likewhy couldnt they put this anywhere else I dont knownBUT overall good place Ill still be coming here alotAs far as DimSum goes these people work hard that is clearly evident Food is never far away if you see something that you like youd better get it because the place is packed and it might not be there the next time the cart comes around The food is good although not the best by most standards Most of the time the food is fried so you can forget about individual flavors Thankfully there is quite an amazing variety of foods and it is fresh I loved the octopus as well as the wonton Chicken feet were available so the wife was impressed We got there late230pmso DimSum was wrapping up and as I said earlier the staff were in the midst of transforming the dining room the staff is on pointThey charge you for tea My boyfriend and I came here for dim sum and when we asked whats this charge on the bill the lady replied for tea How ridiculous never ever been to a dim sum place that charges for cheap tea If youre going to charge for tea make sure you ask if we are going to drink it Bad service and garbage food and ridiculously expensiveI have been to Emerald many times in the past 15 years  nThey used to have pretty good dim sumnnNow that Im old enough to form my own opinion my view of them is somewhat tarnishednn1 the dim sum is often recooked and carted so often that it arrives coldnn2 the carts have some of the most inefficient routes such that it is impossible to get the dishes you want unless you get up and hunt them downnn3 slow service  it took quite a while to get change for the bill  i would have thought they wanted a faster turnaround ratenn4 theyre not exactly cheap for chinese foodnn5 this one really bugged me  last time I went close to end of dim sum and they cracked out the vacuum and started vacuuming right next to my table  Not sure about everyone else but i dont particularly want to eat vacuum dust nor do I enjoy the sights and soundsA great place for hangover lunch The food is good and reasonably priced but can add up very quickly Only a few servers speak English so dont expect a1 servicenVery lively restaurant around lunch time because of dim sum It gets quite loud and rowdy but thats part of the fun nnOverall its a good place to go for cheap dim sum in the Mississauga area that wont disappoint youThe phrase looks can be deceiving certainly applies here Although the decor is nice with bright lights white tablecloths and golden chair covers its ultimate downfall is the food nnThe majority of dim sum items were deep fried Where were the steamed bamboo baskets and rice noodle rolls Cart upon cart  of fried food came by multiple times before we even had one rice noodle roll cart Even the rice noodle roll was disappointing Good rice noodle rolls have a very thin skin These were very thick nnI asked one woman pushing a cart what dumplings she had and she said one was a shrimp biscuit I was dismayed to find it was one tiny shrimp no bigger than my thumb completely surrounded by ground porknnThe staff were awful Apart from yelling at each other from across the room they were curt when we asked for more hot water and they were not very nice nnOne cart lady got impatient and annoyed when we called her over to our table after she skipped us After asking for the fried noodles on her cart she stamped our card then said she would get us a warm plate She disappeared and we didnt see her again We were about to ask someone about this when another lady came with a plate of noodles They were microwaved nnI think its safe to say Ill never come back here again There are so many other good dim sum places Richmond HillMarkham that are definitely worth the drive Do yourself a favour and dont eat hereFood is average but the service is the worse The waiters are rude or indifferent Service is slow We only go here because there arent many dim sum places in the areaMeh  If the ingredients were a little fresher and the recipes are a little healthier it would be worth a review  nnMSG ME  No please dontMy family are regulars at this place and we went today again during one of their peak periods weekends during lunch It was extremely packed  a pretty long wait time I would assume Luckily there are perks to being regulars at this restaurant less wait time attentive service and the tea surcharge is waived nnI generally go here because of the hustle  bustle atmosphere and because the dim sum is relatively consistent in quality Is it the best dim sum I ever tasted Probably not but I still enjoy it because its still one of the best most popular and packed Chinese restaurants in Mississauga its always nice to go to a busy restaurant versus a completely dead one in my opinion  it indicates food is always made fresh for customers If you want the most authentic dim sum experience in this side of town this place is it Theres not many other restaurants that can wheel out fresh  hot food in carts throughout the entire lunch period many other similar restaurants you have to order off a sheet so it may take away from the experience if youve never tried thisnnIf youve never been to dim sum I think going here would be a good experience Its nice to have some prior knowledge of some Chinese food if possible Some of the dishes I order regularly are XO stir fried rice noodle rolls spare ribs in black bean sauce fried crab claw a bit expensive 5 for 2 but a guilty pleasure for sure fried seaweed rollnnOnly negatives about this place could be long wait times not for people who dislike busyloud environments not for extremely starving people you might have to wait if you cant find something you like right away on a cart specialtylarge dishes are expensive not very wheelchair accessible I still found a way but the general layout of the restaurantplaza isnt that friendly for wheelchairsNothing special esp for toronto Probably one of the poorest dim sum i have had in TO Selection was very poor Service slow And they never came to our side with foodThe dim sum here is great The regular menu not so much I havent had a dim sum item not taste good so I cant make any recommendations Try anything Prices are slightly higher than other places but its deservednnLines can be longThe worst dining experience in my entire life Im not talking about the  foods but the quality of service The dim sum lady was rude we asked three times to not serve food that we didnt want and she still ignored us I spoke to the general manager and she seemed not to care or even at least saying sorryCame here for dinner a few days ago Ordered two dishes from the create your own set dinner menu  the braised beef brisket and tendon bowl and the soft scrambled eggs with seafood Came with house soup xe8x80x81xe7x81xabxe6xb9xaf and dessert xe7xb6xa0xe8xb1x86xe6xb2x99 and orange slicesnnThe braised beef was very good if not a bit oily The brisket was fall apart tender and the tendon was perfectly cooked  not too mushy and not too crunchy The inclusion of snow pea shoots was a bit of an unexpected choice of vegetable I would have expected a root vegetable like carrots or turnips but the snow pea shoots ended up being a nice counterbalance to the rich braising liquidnnThe eggs were a bit uneven with some parts being of perfect consistency and the other parts being a touch overcooked The seafood shrimp and scallop was plentiful and tasty My only complaint was that the eggs were quite oily but its kind of to be expected with this dishnnThe house soup was a traditional slow cooked carrot and green turnip soup with preserved mandarin peel and the dessert a standard mung bean soupnnService was on the slow side and they were stingy with the tea leaves nnPrices were reasonablennOverall an OK option for traditional Cantonese food for local residents but there are better options if you go more west and obviously WAY better options if youre willing to go all the way east to MarkhamScarboroughetcWhenever my friend and I are in the mood for dim sum we come here for their discounted dim sum times 9am11am 2pm4pm The food is always hot fresh and delicious We got pork spare ribs har gow shu mai crab claws beef balls tripe and rice noodle rolls with shrimp Everything was so good and only came to about 15person which is great Im definitely coming back hereBelow average in most waysnService quicknFood not fresh or quality  below average throughout nWonton soup badnLarge roomnDimsum lunch may be slightly better than normal dinner items but i doubt its much betterWent for Dim Sum when it was super packed Their dim sum is terrible Everything had corn and ham in it Ive never had corn and ham in my dim sum until this restaurant The carts with the same food go around and around and around with barely anything new The food is dead cold when you get it because they just circle around multiple times We did not understand how it was so packed when the food was absolutely terrible There was that one lady that kept circling around with the same cart with dim sum nobody wanted that she kept persuading people to get Never get anything from her there is a reason why she keeps going around with the same items not newly replenished ones at thatnWe noticed it was packed with a lot of nonchinese as well not sure if their taste is different from what we are used to from all the other dim sum places weve been to our whole life but their hargow and siumai were the worst Ive ever had in my lifennNot worth the 70 we had to pay Maybe their regular nondim sum menu is better but this experience has turned us off completely from going backThis was the 3rd and last time we come here for dim sum If you are not Chinese they sit you at the back where the carts dont come or the food is cold when it does Waited 15 mins for the first cart Service is poor and with the exception of the chicken feet which were great the rest of the dim sum was mediocre and overpricedYou might need to be rude to eatnnEmerald is a Chinese Restaurant that mainly serves as a banquet hall The chairs are all covered with fake silk seat covers similar to an old banquet hall trying to look newer This place is geared for very large groups nnThe food is decent but the service is geared towards survival of the fittest For Dim Sum it seems that you need to make yourself very visible in order to get served Occupied ladies wheel the carts around with no set predictability or pattern Excuse me can we have some more mustard sauce might be the way you might ask for some sauce Here you might have to say WHERE IS THE SAUCE nnBut if you dont mind being rude because they dont then you might like this place Try sitting closer to the window if you can as the Dim Sum carts seem to frequent that area moreDim sum is great  try to get there between 1100 and 1130 on the weekend Too early and the food is not as fresh and too late means waiting for a table Waiters are great in helping to get the cart you want to stop by you Dim sum us supposed to be a longer family experience but with 3 young kids speed is important and we find it pretty speedy usually nnWe have an Asian friend who insists on going to emerald for dinner when in town With her ordering the food is fantasticOh boy have I ever got news to share herennHave been to this restaurant regularly over a 5 year periodnnThe reason I ate here was for nothing more than the food More on this laternnI noticed that as each year passed the food quality and cleanliness declined I was NOT SURPRISED that 5 months ago the Food Inspectors closed the place down It is filthy In March this year I walked into the mens room to find a floor covered in vomit In most restaurants this would be cleaned up immediatelynnFrom Day 1 I felt the rudeness and aggression from the wait staff In particular an elderly heavy set Waiter who actually scowls when serving or taking ordersnnI once brought some European guests of ours fresh from the Airport for Dinner and they were shockeddisgusted by the rudeness My friend asked the Waiter if he had a problem and if all Canadians are this rude lol The bill was about 70 and we did not give him a penny of tipsnnSo back to the service This year I finally decided that I will never eat in this place ever again nn1 The people are R U D E nn2 The place is dirtynn3 Overpriced nnThose of you who are into Holistic life you can feel the bad energy in the roomnnStay awaynnPS unfortunately YElLP s lowest rating is One star so I give it accordingly In reality it deserves NO STARSLooking over the reviews Emerald has mixed ratings I can understand this If youre looking for a nice sitdown with little interaction with your server youre in the wrong place If youre not very good at saying No lol youre so screwed its not even funnynnEmerald is as has been described to me a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place This means you will have food thrown at you from all the servers YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO IF YOU DONT WANT IT nnThere are carts of food making rounds of the huge seating area and they all have different foods on them Yes sometimes you will see the same cart multiple times you just have to be patient The ladies never seen a dude wheeling the carts will often not speak English and will automatically put food on your table for which you will be charged so you have to say No multiple times nnI highly HIGHLY recommend going with someone familiar with how these kind of restaurants work or someone that speaks Mandarin I had no idea what 90 of the food was Luckily the friends I went with knew what was going on and ordered for us all The food is different so you will have to pass your comfort zone and try new things Sometimes the food looked like things Id find growing between my toenails but tasted like heaven should taste Leave your inhibitions at homennIt is WELL worth it Im now a huge fan of pork dumplings as seen in other posts and glazed pork buns I can even order for myself now without going all doeeyed in the face of the waiters Im pretty proud of thatnnTLDR Go to Emerald with someone that speaks Mandarin or understand restaurants like this Learn to say No Leave your inhibitions at homeFinally had reason to create a yelp account Came for a Sunday night family dinner but there were 2 wedding receptions booked Competing sound systems with loud music and emcees slow service and generally terrible experience One star for the ok food and sympathy for the wait staffThere was no beef anything Was there a shortage of cowsnnI didnt even see har gow where are the sui mai what do you mean you dont have beef rice roll no meatballs no lava buns NOTHING What kind of place is this This was a Saturday Everything was just carbsThis place is TERRIBLE Dim sum was cold and had very limited option So we ordered a stir fried rice noodle hoping it would be better Little did we know it would take over 30 mins to be served and sooo not worth the time cus it came out lacking in flavour and had a burnt smell nBut nothing was worst then the HORRIBLE service Rude grumpy old waiters walking around ignoring you and giving dirty looks when u try to get their attention or ask for somethingnTo top off our EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT experience there we were given a bill of 7500  For 2 ppl I was charged almost 550 for tea that I didnt even touched Weve ordered way more at other restaurants and our bill usually estimates around 4050nNeedless to say we are NEVER ever returning there just even the thought of it sickens me ughnnIm only giving this place 1star cus I had to if I could I would give them a negative one million starWent here today for lunch with my mom who just moved in to the adjacent condominium complex behind the restaurant nnThis Place Sucked I mean really badnnMy first instinct this was going to be a rough ride was the fact they there was no appetizing aroma either outside or when opening the front doors My second instinct The decor Weird looking yellow chairs ceiling has watermold stains and the TV is showing SlicennWe were taken to our table by a middleaged Asian man who seemed to have a real problem speaking any language as he spoke like Dr Frankensteins monster There were other guests who seemed to have the same difficulty Then another manager this time a female approached with a cart of items and asked if we wanted the spare ribs and chicken wings We said yes but then realized that she was just going to reheat the ones on the actual cart that were sitting by the front door The ribs were lukewarm and the wings were soggy from the reheat  nnNow as for the menu If you eat in as opposed to takeout there is a price hike supposedly because you are getting more food so dont be surprised by the 15 chicken fried rice and about the same for curry vegetablesnnThe rice was just plain crap No taste or color and the cabbage was slimy and not crunchy in the rice The vegetables were the size of my fist exaggerated but damn folks could you not cut them down to a manageable sizennAll that and Im now 40 in the hole No tip either since we  had to pack our own doggy bag and took home whatever was left as to not waste andor try to shovel it off to someone else Failing that trying to recook it back to some forms of dignitynnShame on whoever cooks the food there seriouslynnThe only plus The cashier was real cuteThe worst service ever I wish there was a 0 star option so I could rate them I came here for dinner with family My father asked for extra chopsticks and the server asked him WHY he needed new chopsticks After explaining that he dropped his and needed new ones a pair of chopsticks taking from a dirty stall finally were given to him from across the table BARE HAND You probably have to know some Chinese when ordering food here as most of the staffs dont speak English I felt like we were begging for food and service attention at this restaurant I dont know how about you but to me it just killed my appetite We ordered deep fried oyster seafood fried rice fried noodle spicy scallop and pecking duck And I have to say these were one of the worst Chinese dishes  I rated Mandarin 3 starsso you know I am not a picky eater here The rice was soggy the spicy scallop was way too salty while the fried noodle was just dry and bland My dinner was ruined I will never come back Avoid at all costHorrible dishes tough beef and very dry fish The portion is tiny and pretty expensive They also charge 25 for a small bowl of rice The service is also exceptionally bad If I could give 0 star thats what it deservesThis is as close as you can get to Hong Kong dim sum here in MississaugannI have been eating here for almost 10 years Surprisingly I managed to write my review just now so Im a little behind The place is huge  banquet style seating They are open pretty early in the morning and close very late at night so its very convenient for a Chinese restaurant in the west GTAnnThe choice is yours Pick up dim sum from the carts slowly strolling in the aisles or order from their menu From their Har Gau shrimp dumplings to their simple Rice Toppings you can always find something good to eat here When I first arrived at Emerald I didnt quite know what to expect It was busier than a shopping mall on a snowy weekend and I probably felt extremely overwhelmed by all the people waiting in the front lobby What I have always learned is that if the restaurant is filled with patrons of its own nationality then the chances are that the food is very good and trustworthy I am telling you all the food is very good herennDim sum carts Depending on the type of food that you pick out will justify the price you must pay Noodles and veggies are cheaper Seafood items are higher in cost If you love seafood as much as I do you wont mind paying for itnnMenu I have eaten several items on the list here for dinner and they all taste great If you order the crab it can get quite expensive so choose wisely based on your budget When dining here with outoftown family or friends I would always recommend buying the crabnnSo what has put off many people is the very rough service treatment You need to keep in mind that delicious Cantonese style food does not equal to quality service As many people have often complained that it can and will be extremely busy during weekends and holidays Im listing several tips for all of you to enjoy the fivestar eating experiencennTip 1 Plan wisely  Weekend dim sum lunch hours is crazy busy and holidays is even worse Unless you are absolutely craving their food beware of rushed and rude servicenTip 2 All your favourite dim sum dishes may or may not be on the carts You can order dim sum dishes straight from the kitchen for the same price But be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes for your order to come out The same can be said about ordering menu items during dim sum hours I have seen people walk out because their order never arrived after eating several dim sum dishesnTip 3 When you need some service get their attention Make eye contact and call over the staff wearing black vests They are the ones you need to order from so dont be shy and call them over nTip 4 When asking for something no need to be rude to them even though they are rude to you When speaking with us needyhungrypolite Canadians during busy times they are very direct because they are trying to keep up with orders Just say what you need and follow up when they forget If you ask for too many things then they will make you feel unwelcomennFor more food reviews and blogging check out my blog at httpsspicychopsticksblogWe came all the way from New York to try this restaurant because it was recommended by some friends  However this is the worst Cantonese restaurant Ive ever been to  We went there for lunch Food was so bad  the beef tasted like it was marinated in some kind of chemicals  I had pretty bad diarrhea after eating at this place  Price was expensive and service was lousy  Will absolutely not go there any moreLast Friday my team from work went to Emerald for dim sum for lunch I drove three of my colleagues over to the restaurant My other colleague took two others nnI decided to go against Google Maps Sometimes I wonder how useful it is to do a uturn instead of turning left at the intersection nnThis plaza gets busy We got there just before noon so we were fine nnWe got a round table There were seven of us We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle nnWe ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there So much for pacing how much we eat nnThe dim sum was delicious Some of my favourites are the followingn Crab claw balls so good especially the meat in the clawn Har gown Sticky rice in fragrant leavesn Rice rolls shrimp and barbeque porknnI had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish nnWe split the bill Each person ended up paying 22 which included the tip I was good with it My boss said that it was expensive This restaurant accepts credit debit and cash nnThe dim sum quality was amazing This restaurant houses a ton of people At one point a tour bus full of tourists came in I would guess that it easily seats 200 people nnId come back here again Its fully licensed which is another reason why I need to come back  nn215Their dim sum and Chinese dishes are better than a lot of other Mississauga ones BUT the 2 stars is because last January 2010  I held my engagement party here and we had worked out a deal because I paid cash up front and on the day of which was one price of 1200 covers 5 tables of catered food  taxes and tips which is not bad nnMy parents went to pay the day of and I was having too much fun taking pictures to go with them The manager the day was such a cheat and liar and told my parents the price did not include the tip so my parents being as trusting as they are gave them an extra 200 on top of it nnI also had given each of our 34 servers a red pocket for lucknnThey also book ours with another huge large party with a microphone so it was really hard to hear anything when speeches or announcements were being made especially for two of my best friends and their parents sitting at the table closest to the other rooms A heads up would have been nicennI didnt find out til a week later when I went to ask my parents if they had change form the 1400 I handed them to pay with SO mad and felt so cheated and my engagement night is now tainted with this memory So since then I have never gone back EVERThis is by far the worst I like how it still have the authenticity of rolling carts with food But the food quality is not good and service is bad I asked for service for 2 times in a row and because of that I was given attitude cause I asked him to get water once and sauce the other time Because of the rolling carts food sometimes comes out coldGreat dim sum Free parking Slow a la cart service but the food is great nnIm more of a quality over quantity kind of gal so if I have to pay a bit more for better tasting food youll find me here The prices are definitely higher than dim sum places in Torontos Chinatown but it tastes so much better Their dishes are also more unique there are a few that Ive only found here and their takes on other kinds are also delicious nnI never have to wait very long to be seated but the a la cart service is a bit slow Helps build up the appetite Id say nnThis is my go to dim sum place Youll always find me here Unfortunately their wifi doesnt work but who needs wifi when you have good foodIve been here twice Once during Chinese New Year They have good dim sumnnThe second time my family went wasnt so good The food was a little cold We found a rubber band in the vegetables The manager crossed off the item on the list after explaining what happenednnThey likely did not wash the veggies since the rubber band was found among them Is that standard in restaurantsnnDespite the manager having crossed the item off the list we still got charged for it We had to talk to a few staff members until we found someone that could speak adequate English the manager was busy elsewherennDim sum was good admittedly The service however is not so good I would avoid the placeI was craving dim sum the day before so my parents took me out for dim sum today We arrived around 1030 am so it wasnt busy at all However it took a while to flag down staff members at the beginning of our visitnnMost of the food that we got were carted out but we also ordered a few items that we didnt see being carted out It is a bit expensive because it came out to 55 including tax and tip for only the three of us Some of my faves today were the scallops shumai noodle roll with shrimp and the curry squidnnOverall it was an average dim sum experience Food was good but service was nonexistent at the beginningDirty cheap ingredients bad service most of the time  How do they stay in businessThe atmosphere in the dining room looks nicer than most Chinese restaurants  Its slightly dated but there are glimmering chandeliers everywhere Persian printed broadloom and nice curtains  nnHaving said that washrooms could be nicer  Again this is another Chinese place where warmhot water in the restrooms is not even an option  Only ice cold water flows out of faucet  And certain stalls are used as storage spaces for cleaning supplies  I really dont like this  It makes me question their cleanlinessnnFoodwise there seems to be quite a large selection for dim sum  Service was also nicer than most places and the staff tried to find out what dish someone in our group wanted but didnt know what it was called  Initially they brought the wrong dish but didnt make a fuss when we said that that wasnt the dish  They also took that extra step by taking out a binder with coloured photos in order to try to identify the particular item  This gets them extra pointsnnOur table ordered so much that we were given 10 discountnnWould get more s if the washrooms matched with the rest of the dining room  Food is alright I guess fancy dining room AND more selection tricks people into thinking that food is better than it actually is but I find it just alrightWhat a joke Service was awful and dim sum was terrible Dont believe the hype for best dim sum in Mississauga Go to Rol San in Toronto Never coming backSo heres the drill HUGE venue I mean banquet hall with the matching drapesstage decorationchairstable cloth kind of banquet hall Full bar no alcohol on tap though The servers are kind of rude and snappy but the service is very fast As for the food IT IS AMAZING The portions are huge absolutely delicious and cooked fresh and the prices are extremely reasonable I ordered the Sautxc3xa9ed jumbo shrimp and grilled vegetables as a healthy option and the shrimp was delicious It was perfectly cooked very light very big very yummy and there was so much of it I struggled to finish My boyfriend ordered the sweet  sour chicken with noodles and they were both great Definitely recommend for a fun night out to much with friends  nnPS They serve you green tea in a little pot when youre first seated and orange slices and fortune cookies after your mealThis is one of the few places Ive seen that still has carts I miss that Given I guess you have to strategize to know whats fresh or not nnThe food was okay Not spectacular but very good A great place to come for a work celebration or work lunch  The clientel is mostly local Chinese folk or people that work near by nnThey are SO aggressive here On many of an occasion they would put plates on our table and say here you like this Were likeno thanks full No you like this And when I say no a second time they take it back one of them was ever grumbling how we didnt want vegetablesnIts like they make a commission here or something nI would suggest know what you want and dont succumb to their ploys nnThey are super busy around here so dont be afraid of putting up your hand and flagging someone down nnim not sure of the price for each dish but for 10 people we paid about 18 PER PERSONTerrible terrible service We were there for dinner Food was good when it came but anticipate waiting for a long time We were there during Chinese New years celebrations and they shouldve anticipated that it would be busy It was disorganized and chaos with servers and kitchen staff All the patrons seemed annoyed with the serviceWent on a Sundayxe2x80x8b morning around 11 and was seated immediatelyxe2x80x8b Im not sure why the ratings for this place is so low but Im a fan Great place far better than any dim sum place back in the states They were missing some of my dim sum favs but everything we had was really great Only downside was that we had a large party and when a cart comes by wed take a couple of plates but all the food would be gone in a minute We would then have to sit a while waiting for the next cart to come over and since we were in the far corner carts were few and far betweenHave been here a few times but will never go back Reason is the excruciatingly long wait for carts and carts that all seem to be missing standard favourites like Har Gow Sticky Rice and Siu Mi Inquiries about when those items might be appearing are simply met with later or soon meanwhile the congee and desert carts have just come around for the seventh time nnMaking a special order for any items will result in about a 30 minute wait not even kidding The food off the carts is more often than not cold which doesnt help nnBasically they have enough Dim Sum carts for a restaurant a quarter of the size Its actually quite comical watching other diners constantly looking around for carts and crying out in unison Where is the food nnIf you want to wait over an hour just to get a few standard Dim Sum dishes that are available quickly anywhere else than go for it Last time I was there I gave up and left after an hour and twenty minutes after having only eaten half of what I came forFood was awful I do like Chinese food but this one was tasteless and smelled terrible I couldnt wait to get my bill and leave They call this thing restaurant I wouldnt go there again even if it is only one place on the earth where I can get food highly disappointedCame on a weekday

foodnnnot coming back here anytime soonWeve come to Emerald for both dim sum and dinner before  This review will be for dinnernnOur group of 6 arrived around 7pm on a Friday night  The restaurant was about half full  They seated us at a round table that was a bit lop sided and unsteady because it was a piece of plywood screwed to some fold out table legs  We asked to be moved to another table since we saw plenty available ones and they obliged nnWe ordered one of the set menus for 88 which includednn House soupnn 1 jumbo steamed crab in a light butter sauce with onions  I dont eat crab that often but its probably one of the best Ive tasted  Lots of meat not too much work needed to dig it out  The meat was very fresh and not overdone  nn Cold jellyfish and roast pork with crispy

leftovers with the bill coming to 140 before tipI had a great time in this restaurant Came here for dinner with a party of 5 The service was very friendly they didnt speak fluent English but you can communicate with them easily The place is just OK cleanliness is moderate but food was excellent We ordered the lobster sword fish fried rice chicken curry snow pea leaf with garlic and beef sautxc3xa9 everything was great So tasty and delicious I would recommend the fried rice and curry The potion size is huge Its best if you shareNever had a bad experience here The food is extremely authentic and if you come for lunch it literally arrives in seconds My favourites are the chicken feet shrimp dumplings and congee n  I understand that most people complain about the service but you have to understand that this isnt your typical American sitin restaurant nOverall great place for dim sum and Ill definitely be backFairly good food Lots of options for dimsum and they still have the carts Dinner is also very delicious We ordered scallops and broccoli garlic gai lan sweet and sour pork ginger beef crispy chicken and Cantonese chow mein Also reasonably priced 130 including tax and ti for 8 peopleThis is one of the Cantonese restaurants that I frequent in MississaugannI come mainly for the dim sum lunchnnWhat I like is the food is still pushed around on carts just like in the old school daysnAs a result you get to eat pretty quickly on your arrivalnOne thing to watch out for is because you are hungry on arrival you might tend to over order Like they say your brain is bigger than your stomach nnHowever no worries here as we pretty much always take home the left overs for our kidsHorrible parking actually had to park across the street and cross Hurontario   Mediocre dim sum cold and greasy  Abrupt service  And 50 more expensive than what I thought   Ill stick to Tremendous thankyouIve been to many authentic Chinese restaurants in my life This one is the best The staff is very professional and helpful the place is clean and the food is exceptional There is one TV screen and instead of the usual Highway TrafficCamera and the Breaking News they show clips of how traditional dishes are made in China I will definitely be back with more friendsFamilys Go To Dim Sum placennAlways a good time here People always complain about service  but you should know what youre getting into Its a dim sum place nnThe food never disappoints I cant even name a dish that wasnt good The cart dim sum give its that fun experience of the excitement of seeing the cart come by Whats in the cart Its great for kids and adults The price has gone up in the last couple of years but honestly its expected The food never disappoints and i will be back nnRecommendationsn For weekends come around 1030am Any later and youll be trapped in a crowd of chaos n The manager lady always tries to sell a couple dishes that she runs around with Dont get them They are usually the older items that wasnt soldn Theres an automatic charge for tea per person consider that when tipping n If there is a certain item you want and cant seem to find on the carts just ask the people in the black vest They can always preorder for you n be ready to eatThe food is horrible They should be embarrassed to serve this Had lemon chicken which was certainly cooked and served days before and rethermed for us Completely inedible Save your money and frustration Avoid this place at all costs45 StarsnI love Dim Sum so I decided to give Emerald a try and boy was I sure glad I did I came here for breakfast a few times and always came out happy  I also came here for dinner a few times  I hope this tells you just how much I love Dim Sum LOLnThe crispy squid was delicious crispy hot yummilicious and the roast duck was absolutely delicious Will definitely come here again Came in for lunch today but not for dim sum It was for my nephews baby moon so a ten course was orderednnThis is not in my neck of the woods either so I cant really compare it to other places in MississaugannSince it WAS dim sum hour it was really hectic At no fault of the restaurant though Customer service was still pretty good herennThe food was average we had the standard banquet dishes of crab claw ball garlic pea shoots steamed fish crispy chicken etc Nothing stood out and nothing was terrible nnWe did order a few dim sum dishes afterwards like chicken feet and siu mai nnI cant comment on the pricing either nnOverall it was alright but like I said Im never in Mississauga so Id only be back if there was a function thereIm a huge fan of Emerald In fact its a destination I rent a car to go there Its that good The selection the delicious hot sauce the pageantry Its all there to enjoy  Its the King of Dim Sum in the GTA as far as Im concerned Its always consistent and its authentic  I just avoid looking in the fish tanksThe service was nearly nonexistent and extremely rude Had 3 or 4 different servers come to our table and they would literally throw our plates on the table and leave without saying anything Our food came out one at a time there were 8 of us and there was probably 510 minutes in between each order It really was that bad Funny how all the other tables around us got great service and their food delivered in a timely fashion and all together NEVER going backFour out of Five stars for a traditional Chinese restaurant The decor and ambiance is what you would expect from such a place However it is our favorite place to go when we have a hunkering for DimSum The food is fresh and tasty Service is good and price is right A la cart is also very good and there are a lot of good traditional Chinese dishes same as you would find in China I enjoy Emerald Ask for TsingTao beer with your meal and try the pork belly and  and also the lobster dishesVery authentic chinese food Excellent service clean nice ambience  The decoration is typical to fine chinese restaurants in China  I have been in different parts of China several times so I can truly know when a place is authentic  The waiter who assisted us was very kind and trying and achieving his best to understand us and serve us good  The food was fresh tasty and good quality  Everything seemed clean and ambience mediummediumhigh class people  Is the type of chinese restaurant you will enjoy if looking for authentic and fine chinese food  Prices a bit high but the restaurant deserves it for the foodserviceambiance qualitynnSo far the best chinese restaurant we have found in Mississauga  We took our leftovers home happily and definitely going backHorrible place extremely dirty Could not drink water cuz glassses were gross Service was v bad cold food served Dont ever ever go thereOne a few that I know of dim sum restaurant in Mississauga on the way to the premium outletsnnCome before 11am as their was a huge back log after that even though the place is largennThis is a cart service place but a few items you have to order from the waiter en  Sui maipork dumplings which is a staple of dim sum food choices so go figure  they finally came and pretty smallnnAny ways had better in Markham and worse downtown toronto Chinatown so 3 stars is averageMy familys go to dim sum restaurant It gets quite busy on the weekends so expect a wait They have cart service until 1 pm but you can also order dim sum through the servers Food is always consistent and good Still cant find another dim sum restaurant that the whole family enjoysHorrible   just awful nNever go back again nOverpriced and low quality food and serviceWent for dim sum yesterday my first time for lunch and it sure was a different experience The restaurant was extremely busy but we still managed to get a table right away nnThe first thing I was confused about was how it worked I saw carts of food all around but only later realized thats how they serve you Also I had absolutely no idea how pricing worked for this and had to ask a waiter Even after that I wasnt sure as most of them cant speak English so it was hard to communicate nnThe food itself wasnt bad It tasted pretty decent but I wasnt impressed with anything just satisfied We tried a few things including chicken feet which was an interesting experience The spices on the chicken feet tasted good but there was almost no meat on it I guess that is expected but when I looked at the dish it looked more meaty I wish they had like another chicken dish with the spices they marinated and cooked the feet in nnOverall the experience was something new to me but the food doesnt leave me wanting more I was drinking water like crazy for the next 3 hours after as the meal left me extremely thirsty MSG nnI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you really want to try traditional dim sum onceThe food is okay I dont know if its kung pao chicken or the general tao but one of them tastes horrible The lemon chicken however tastes very good Its a normal tasting Chinese food that I find quite overpricedNarito kami kahapon  Dumating kami mga 1640  Liban sa aming mesa meron 2 sluhan ng kasaldiwang nakadivider  Sa labz may konstruksyon ng

ko sa resto natioI took my clients here  The experience was the usual  We ordered a number of dishes  Unlike some other Chinese restaurants this location does not provide a complimentary pork bone Chinese soup to start  But they do provide complimentary red mung bean soupnnI was treating caucasian clients  I was very happy that they did not offend my clients asking if they wanted forks and knifes thank you  Eventually they needed and we were servednnWe were provided one pot of tea eventually two pots but the tea leaves were not replenished and so tea was quite washed and lightnnAt the end of our dinner we were served red mung bean soup  It was moderately sweet  It was okay but quite filling because its made with glutinous flour or just boiled too long that the tapioca has thickening it  I give the server props for observing my caucasian clients did not like it and quickly came to the rescue with fortune cookies to that my client were like Yea AwesomennIt could be five star but two reasons stopped mennFirst at a previous visit for dim sum I found that when I had caucasian clients with kids the servers take advantage of the kids amusement with crab claw dim sums because kids like playing with food  I will honestly say its pretty pricey to order half a dozen of premium dim sum dishesnnSecond this restaurant does not serve any dishes that are diabetichigh cholesterol customers  I can never take health sensitive clients for dim sum and the dinner options really dont have clean optionsThis place has hands down the worst food and service that I have experienced in a while nThe decor was super tacky The carpet chairs and the stage were all covered in a gold colour To top it off the cloth on the chairs was very dirty nThe servers could not care less about cracking a smile When asked for the dumping menu I was given a photo album with just pictures I then had to ask for another menu that had the description of dumplings Upon this the server got irritated nThe food was super gross The crab and corn soup had a bad fishy taste The chicken balls were 90 batter and 10 chicken They were also fried in an old oil The only thing that was decent was the scallop dumplings nPlease avoid this place at all costs I will not be returningIm told this restaurant has been around for numerous years and the rest of my party were regulars here Inside it reminded me of a typical Chinese restaurant  golds and reds fish tank things werent new but not too old There were a number of tables seated and the bigger tables around the edge of the restaurant were filled or had reservationsnnThere was a dinner combo set menu available as well as a regular xc3xa0 la carte menu My table ordered off the xc3xa0 la carte probably for flexibility in getting exactly what we wantnnThe soup came out first  it looked hopeful with greens and meats visible but the taste was watery and bland It was also apparent the service was going to feature kindhearted ladies with fairtoaverage serving skills as the soup ladling job was all over the place literallynnOther dishes came out eventually featuring sweet and sour pork thousand island sauce deep fried pork egg tofu with baby shrimp garlic shoots and squid with chili sauce XO sauce string beans fish fillet with peasa collection of fairly simple dishes that one could make at home but would require a hefty grocery run to accomplish all in one dinner Overall everything tasted good and nothing was poorly done though the garlic shoots and string beans were much spicier than expected There were no foodrelated complaints around the table otherwise Dessert was sliced oranges and red bean soup  standard nothing specialnnI was impressed by the variety of dishes available at Emerald and satisfied by the pricing  my table of 16 came out to only 1650 each for what I felt was a large variety of dishes While nothing stood out nothing was utterly dissatisfying either which is a great accomplishment given the size of my party Personally  I felt more interesting and more flavourful dishes can be found in Markham and Richmond Hill but for being in Mississauga it wasnt bad at allIve visited this place many times growing up  my parents have often used it as a goto for celebrating special occasions and family events and weve also dropped by for weekend dim sum many times When you get right down to it this place is basically a Chinese restaurant moonlighting as a banquet hall Very elaborate and ornate decor think gold seat covers seating to fill a legit army this place is huge  if youre looking to seat a large group this is a good place to start and good variety to the menu and dim sum carts nnIt isnt the cheapest dim sum spot in the area but if your main concern is making reservations and ensuring space for a larger group of people this is a safe bet The food itself is pretty decent  food from the menu is a decent size tasty and comes out quickly Theres good variety to the dim sum choices lots of dishes to choose from and the carts come by often nnOverall a decent choice Note they also take reservationsI went here today for dim sum and I love it The dim sum ordering style may be outside your comfort zone if youre not used to itnYou order food as you see them come around on carts flagging down workers and picking however many dishes you want from the cart They will mark down the types of dishes you got which will add to your total Different carts have different items but the same carts will come around quite oftennIts a great way to eat with your eyes picking food that looks good and they taste good too Highly recommend the deep fried squid tentacles a light crunch on the outside but soft and moist squid on the insideI travel all the way from Thornhill to Mississauga just to eat at Emerald because I enjoy the traditional experience of eating dim sum I find that the food is always fresh and there is always new items every time I go there The servers are friendly and theres good customer service The cha siu and the peking duck are a must when you go I highly recommend dining at this restaurant when youre in Mississauga and looking for authentic Chinese food Plus there is FREE WIFIIm shocked I havent reviewed this place This is my go to dim sum place on the weekend in the ssaugnnWho doesnt love carts of steaming bamboo containers being pushed around you Its packed though Go before 11am or after 1pm They serve dim sum until 4pm on the weekends Then it becomes a regular Chinese restaurant  I have totally made that mistake before although their chicken wasnt badnnThis places charges for tea so make sure you want tea before you ordered it It can get pricey and thats how a lot of dim sum places get younnI see some of the other reviewers saying how you had to be firm and you do All the cart ladies want to pawn their food on you Especially if you arent Asian Also if you want to order anything off the menu or even get extra napkins you will have to flag down one of the servers in the black vests They take their division of labour very seriouslynnYou should order a side of the stir fry snow peas They dont normally bring that out Its solidnnMy personal favourites are the scallop dumplings they are known for their scallop dishes seafood dumplings chicken feet crab claw and fried tofu wrapnnIm probably going this weekend Thinking about it makes me hungryCame here for dim sum today with family just me and 3 others We went very early on a Saturday at around 10am They were just beginning to roll out food and it didnt get busy until about noon The dim sum selection was good with lots of traditional dishes that other dim sum places dont make anymore I really liked the crab claw It was pretty tasty although not the best Ive ever had The same can be said about every other dish we had Good but not exceptional nnWhy wont I come back again Because the bill came out to 80 with tipand they charged me wrong originally so I had to go to the counter and talk to them before I got almost 30 refunded The service was mediocre A couple of time the carts almost went by and we had to flag it down to grab something off of it It wasnt the worst service but it certainly wasnt memorable either and at the prices they are charging compared to other parts of Toronto I was expecting moreTook my parents here recently to celebrate a birthday and left disappointed This place used to have great dimsum but now I no longer think its worth the drive The chicken feet was really good though so many if I have an exclusive craving for that Ill come back The service is a lot better rhan what it used to be and we were pleasantly surprised that the staff were friendly and attentiveIts been awhile since Ive visited this restaurant and I must say that this time around I actually enjoyed the food we ordered Its not exactly the best I ever had but comparing it to the food I had years ago at this place says a lotnnPrices are still up there in my opinion but then again a lot of produce are getting ridiculously expensive now a daysnnDecor needs an update if anyone cares And also theres a ton of seating in this place and the staff was attentive its hard to use the term friendly because they werent lol when we came in and our service was promptnnParking at the front of the restaurant can be busy but theres more parking around the back if the front is full nnOverall not the best one in Mississauga but its not bad place to go eitherVile  This was one of the worst examples of food quality out there The fried rice was just plain greasy but not fried and crispy like it should be  The lemon chicken was HARD and a funny color  so disgusting  It was dismal and inedible I would absolutely recommend you MISS this placeWasnt that great Taste of the food was blend Not authentic chinese food Ambiance very loud Servers were screaming among themselves and they forget they have customers who are close to them Been hurting our ears the whole time nWas weird seeing the lady server removing a fish from the tank to show a customer and kept talking with the fish still alive in her net Since the customer didnt want it she kept pushing it Then finally drop the fish back in the tank

craving Chicken Teriyaki  gyoza so we found Musashi I was very unimpressed We started with gyoza and edamame Neither were anything special We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce Was not good at all The sushi was mediocre at best While they were friendly and the service was pretty good  I will not be backWent there Saturday noon they open at 12pm but people were waiting outside before 12pm so you can tell it should be a good place Nice Katsu  Eel with rice Many Japanese go thereWent to this restaurant on Saturday as I had a craving for a Japanese ramen It was packed for Saturday dinner We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll donkotsu ramen and katsu jyupork cutlet with egg nnAfter soft shell crab roll was served first we waited for 30minutes for other dishes They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waitingnnThe ramen was served and soup was very rich but saltyor was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accidentI liked the noodle though Katsu jyu was katsudon in a bento box style Katsu was okay not that crispy enough I maybe expected too muchauthentic japanese ramen and donkotsu as I heard the owner was Japanese They can do better nIt leaves a lot to be desired 3stars for the food and 2stars for the serviceThis place will always have a place in my stomaerrrheart  I have been coming here since high school and I had graduated in 05 woot  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping centernnI like Musashi as its small and intimate in there  They have booths tables a small bar but what I really like is to sit in their room  It looks like youd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor but there is openings for you to hang your feet  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the roomnnI prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck  When you go in during lunch make sure to look towards your right and youll see A B C lunch options  Those options arent on the menu and change daily  nnMy favorite thing to get here is the TonKatSu  Man on man  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life this would be it  It never disappoints  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing  If you think you cant get more salad dressingYOU CAN  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my hearts delightnnThe staff here is really nice and youll always see the same familiar faces when coming in  Come check them out  I promise youll enjoy their foodWell first time Ive really had authentic Japanese nonAmericanized no chicken covered in sugar sauce here The Chicken Katsu is what I laid my eyes upon and I was pleasantly surprised when it came out A good portion of chicken with many veggie and fruit options highly recommendnnThe place is small The service is courteous but slow Those are negative remarks that only hold it back slightly If you enjoy changing it up on your taste buds check it outI just came back from living in Japan for two years and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants Ive been to Not only that but the prices arent too bad either I had some kind of vegetarian nabe like a one pot dish and beef tongue my friend had the tonkatsu fried pork cutlets they gave more than one which was a surprise and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank maybe about 30 a person with tip and everythingnnThe atmosphere is nothing special Its a small restaurant in a strip mall but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style if thats your thing Personally Id rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant so I didnt mind at allnnAllinall I think Ill definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food thats a bit tough to find in CharlottennThe key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese which is always a good signFirst of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESEstyle sushi house If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture this will not be the restaurant for you nnJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan Americans and we southerners especially are not used to this type of service This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese If you eat lunch between 12PM you will have better servicennThe food is also VERY Japanese The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice If you are not accustomed to Japanese food then you may want a nonJapanese sushi bar like Sushi101 Mexican made or Rusans Indonesian made or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if thats your idea of sushinnI have eaten here every week for years It is a small restaurant with basic rolls They are very consistent and the food is always excellent I have never gotten brown wasabe or fish that I didnt know what it was The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll a maki roll soup salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about 8nnI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture Now that I have explained it to you maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashis great food If great service is most important to you find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai HouseLocated in a small plaza is an authentic Japanese restaurant Very small establishment but has a seating area where you can sit down and feel like your in a Japanese house Service was excellent got seated immediately and food came out really quickly faster than Sonics Limited on choices for lunch but all was excellent Soft rice to crispy katsu equals great quality Will be coming back again to try others on the menu Recommend the KatsuDon and Katsu CurryWaiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before It was rather salty instead  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback In any case Im not giving Musashi up yet since its close to home cooking nn030317 A Friday DinnernDisappointed It was packed tonight Had to wait about 15 mins for a table Then had to wait 4550 for our food But the waiting wasnt the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile WRONG nnThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right  cut thick n all the same size I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA No MSG No thirst after the meal And the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco nnTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters Hmm I guess Im ole fashion n lived in Japan too long nnI also ordered three uni sashimi Hey Whats with the same price of 350 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi But I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi qualitynnWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG lots n lots nnThe tempura shrimp was perfect not doughy or undercooked nnStill since its near Im not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next timeTonkatsu RamennITADAKIMASnnThis place is authentic nYoull find several decent types of sake and small plates here from Shisamo to hamachi kamanif you have not had either you should try it Their agedashi tofu is also awesomennThey have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen The tonkatsu is good but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorfulnnI had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for moreWe decided to try Musashi on Friday night after reading some other Yelp reviews and Im happy to say it was a great experience  Everyone in there seemed like regulars several were commenting that it was busier than usual on a Friday night and some seemed to have their table  Just like another reviewer said I always take it as a good sign when I visit an ethnic restaurant and see it full of people from that ethnicity  We were definitely in the minority at Musashi and so I knew the food would be very authentic and awesomennThe service was a little slow and disorganized so thats the only reason I cant give Musashi 5 stars  I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner that came with rice and miso soup and it was fantastic  We also had the vegetable spring roll appetizer  My food arrived to the table about 15 minutes prior to my husbands sushi  Wouldve been nice to eat together but it wasnt a deal breaker  Like I said a little disorganized but otherwise very good  nnWe will definitely go back to Musashi  great food authentic experience and well pricedIm a huge fan of Japanese and Ramen and growing up in Hawaii  its hard to find what I like This place is like someones grandma made food for you its the best Its not super fancy greatness of the food is mostly in how its done and whats in it It is  well prepared yummy and delicious  Its not going to break my bank because its fancy  Its simple I have hit every ramen place in town and this is the place I go to 90of the timeAwesome We had the fried baby crabs they were so good that we placed a second order I could have eaten just those for dinnernnHubby had the Sushi Deluxe plate and enjoyed the chefs selections I ordered the Chirashi and it was greatnnI have to mention their salmon It was fresh buttery and utterly delightful Im craving it now that Im typing thisnnTheir service was prompt and friendly The restaurant is small but efficientnnWe have found our new favorite sushi in Charlotte and will be at Muashi Japanese Restaurant oftenIve been visiting this restaurant only because this is the only place I can get Japanese home style dishes such as Katsuju Tenju or grilled fish with rice and misoshiru nnDecent Japanese restaurants would put some grated daikon with grilled fish Especially for these prices Everything is so skimpy and jobs are sloppy nnService You dont have to take your dishes fromto kitchen Thats all about itnnThis place used to be filled with Japanese business persons after work and Japanese families Not many Japanese customers now No wondernnI keep praying for a decent authentic Japanese restaurant coming to Charlotte For now I just drive to the Triangle Its worth 25 hour drivingJapanese owned Japanese restaurant nI had a Chirashi couple of days ago it was very goodnThey have verity of Japanese food not only teriyaki sushi or rollsn5 starsIm a fan of their food  service is a different story I have been here on several occasions and theres always a stone cold looking older Japanese lady who never cracks a smile Honestly Im more scared of her than anything else The other ladies are nicer but please keep in mind language is a definite barrier ex asking for anything more than the basics will likely not get you any answer Having a large party in that tatami room is nice but it is not the best idea during Friday  Saturday nights peak time lets just say it can be very chaoticnnWith that being said I love their food Its my friends favorite place for ramen and Japanese homecooking They have some sushi but not a big selection Personally I prefer nigiri and sashiminnThey have a Japanese menu  I found out from my parents Chinese friends Again communicating with the waitstaff is difficult but its worth the work to order something differentThis is my second time here and both times the waitresses have been rude Especially the older cockeyed lady Weve waited for over an hour the first time I went and 40 minutes the second time When I came in today I saw the tatami styled table was available so I asked one of the waitresses if we could sit at the bigger tabletatami styled table because we had a party of 7 Her response was uh no  I didnt understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away The first time I went after waiting an hour one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldnt be seated It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible They need a bigger entrance a hostess and better management They didnt give us enough menus or silverware and didnt ask what we wanted to drink The floor is extremely sticky not sure why I guess they dont clean the floors As for the food I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses If you still decide to go try the tenpura lunch or katsujyu I tried to give them a second chance but Ive never felt this disrespected before Maybe I will try again far far far far far far far far into the future Not happy at all Not only that but every one at the table except one person got their food and he had to wait an extra 25 minutes for his I also had to go grab a napkin and a pair of chopsticks myself because they didnt provide me with one How disappointingVery authentic Japanese restaurant in the area Im a native JapanesenFriendly service and nice atmospherenBento box is a very good valuenWould be nice if they had more appetizer optionsThis place is a hidden gem Ive heard of this place but never really took the time to stop This place is pretty authentic The decor is even authentic The place is small and the tables are close together I decided to get ramen with the miso broth It was savory and delicious It was filling and just plain good My husband got the sushi platter and he was pretty pleased with it He said it was very fresh Overall this place is good Please note they do not do any substitutionsFood is honestly really good The place to go for ramen in the Queen City Huge Downside is the Service  Eating out is an experience and they clearly havent figured this outI love sushi and japanese food  I was looking for a gem  My wife and I tried Musashi and she got food poisoning from the teriyaki chicken  My sushi was decent but it did not make up for the chicken  Obviously  Granted this dinner was a few months ago so hopefully they have improvedThis was my first trip to Musashi  I ordered the pork ramen and my girlfriend ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetable udon  We also ordered an eggplant in light sauce appetizer Everything was extremely good  The ramen seemed extremely authentic  It even had one of those little fish cakes in it The udon was the best I have had in town  nnI will definitely go back and try their sushi and order more soup even though it is about a 25 minute drive for me to get thereI acquired a taste for Japanese food during my frequent business trips to South East Asia and Japan In India it is impossible to find good Japanese food without paying eyepopping prices When I moved to the US in 2009 Id expected to be much better off Columbia SC where I worked was not exactly the big city Id hoped to live in and dining options were very limited So Charlotte is where I ventured for some varietynnMusashi is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte I used to stop by here every time I drive through Charlotte or would come to the Charlotte airport to pick up my girlfriend I moved to Charlotte in 2010 and thought that Id be a regular visitor after that The 1011 mile drive from uptown where I stay meant that I actually visited them even less frequently than when I lived in ColumbiannId say that the Sushi has gotten better here from what I remember from my 1st visit in 2009 But the real treats here are the Ramen love the Tonkatsu Ramen and the Japanese menu my faves are the Fish Liver and the Beef  Tofu Ingredients are topnotch For example just try the fried squid  perfectly cooked and the best quality that Ive had anywhere including Singapore nnMy girlfriend had been very relucatant to try Japanese food because she was always worried about using chopsticks One visit to Ippudo NYC convinced her that she needed to eat more Japanese food We went to Musashi twice this weekend when she flew down to visit me  Sat lunch and Sun dinner So now she is a convert toonnIt is not cheap But Id say that it is great value for money  you do get more than what you pay for Excellent service nice traditional kind of ambience that is way more than the outside strip mall exterior might suggest And most of all fantastic food that I will miss when I move from Charlotte in April Authentic Japanese food in a friendly atmospherennWe had the savory tonkatsu ramen crispy and moist katsu chicken and perfectly sliced and fried vegetable tempura for dinner  Starters were gyoza get two orders these went so fast potato croquettes and age dashi tofu  Real green tea was a very pleasant surprise toonnI suppose the true testament to the quality of the food was the customer base over 50 Japanese touristsvisitors in the time we were thereThis restaurant seems actually run by Japanese people which is rare for a Japanese restaurant in the US It also seems to receive a good number of Japanese regulars which is always a good sign I see theyre trying to be authentic in their food I lived in Japan and I can tell nnAnyway the ramen I tried I guess you just cant make it as good as youd get in Japan It is pretty ordinary ramen stuff you could make with the material you gather from an asian market without much efforts but pricey not as meh and pricy as the ones I tried in St Marks Place in NYC though those were absolute ripoffs and were literally cupnoodles in bowls nnThe lunch sushi plate I didnt try but I saw a sample display at the entrance  the usual cheapie American style sushi ie a bunch of makis easy to make a bunch easier to cheat the flavor of lower quality sashimi not accidentally never ever seen served in restaurants in japan fake crab meats seriously why would any supposedly authentic japanese restaurant serve this crap Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive etcnnOK food Really not much better but certainly not worse than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte and the prices were OK The Japanese regulars seems to frequent the place because they know it cannot get any better in Charlotte as far as Japanese cuisine goes not because the food there is as good as theyd get back home So what can you doBest authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte The sushi is always fresh and delicious From simple rolls like the California roll to their more complex and modern rolls like the Yankee Roll is delicious Everything else on the meal is great Ive had their ramen katsu almost everything and its delicious nnIt is a small restaurant so I would call and make a reservationnnThey also have specials and certain items that arent on their menu Just ask if you want to try something new and excitingThey have very fresh sushi for a good price  Very yummy ramen too  My hubby and I went there for the second weekend now  We like to sit at the bar and watch the sushi chef work and they are also quick with excellent serviceVery disappointed after reading the generous reviews about the authenticity We really wanted to like this place as a sushiAsian alternative to some of our favorites including Sushi Guru Tsuki Futo Buta Asian18 etcand much prefer the freshness and service they offernnThe staples to Japanese food are rice which was good and seafood which was of mediocre quality Most portions were small and pricey and not impressive The limited lunch menu left a lot to be desired with many popular items only on the dinner menu such as teriyaki salmon sushi ramen etc we had to ask for sushi menus which seemed to be a rare exception nnWe may try dinner or carry out hesitantly and try to naviagate the good parts of their menu if they let us Good luck to Masushi and their customersA must tryThis is an adorable place with very friendly staff The food was excellent I had the teriyaki plate Everything on the plate was to die for My husband got the bento box a little bit of everything He came away stuffed Even with me stealing samples  Picky eater daughter got he Ramen bowl and loved itAll I have had is the ramen Thats all I need to know I had shoyu ramen and it was amazing Flavorful broth and great chew to the noodles Love the bok choy and pork tooThey are one of the few if not the only Japanese familystyle restaurant in the South Charlotte  Uptown area  With only 10 tables served by three wait staff during peak hours be prepared for a small wait for a table at weekends nnThey have lunch sets that change on a daily basis which offer a good choice of salads sushi and small bites We also enjoy coming here in the evenings and ordering from the Izakaya style Japanese menu that includes a good selection of grilled fish saury mackerel and hokke Their sushi is also ok but it wont knock you off your chair in terms of freshness and tasteFamily went to Mizuho and found that it was closed 71110 This was a huge letdown  seems another sushi restaurant with a different name is taking its place  will just have to wait and see how it turns outnnAnyway we went to Musashi as a second choice and it was not nearly as nice as Mizuho Atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy I ordered Sushi Deluxe which was OK and came with miso soup but no salad as most places serve and a Kirin beer Wife ordered individual nigiri with spicy tuna roll  also OK And daughter ordered teriyaki chicken  poor at best chicken breast apparently baked with sauce poured on top very plain salad small amount of noodlesand bowl of rice The girls chose water to drink Despite below average restaurant and food service was very goodnn75 Sushi is expensive and that is OK but this was too much for below average atmosphere and food Add a tip and the meal was nearly 90  last trip to MusashinnSo the search is on for good sushi in South CharlotteI have given up on Japanese food in CharlottennAny restaurant that fails to acknowledge the customer for over 5 minutes is never going to be good in my book Musashi makes it easy by serving average food to go with their incredibly crappy servicennWe came in the door and waited by the register for over 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us The place is pretty small so its not like they couldnt see us The sushi chefs kept looking at us but never moved a muscle to signal the waitresses that we were waitingnAfter we sat down we ordered beer which arrived soon but after that the service was back to crap nnWe ordered tamago sushi which never arrived and we had to ask another waitress to get it because our original waitress simply stopped attending tables The tamago was quite good nnI got the Udon which was basically chicken broth and noodles with a little green onions sprinkled on it A monkey can be more creative than that and I certainly did not enjoy paying 9 for it It had no taste no spices not even any soy sauce in it It was literally broth and noodles I showered it with their chilli flakes so I could trick myself into thinking it was eatablennOh and the service wasnt bad for all customers  these two Japanese guys came in and the wait staff fell over each other trying to please them Every other table was being ignored but these two basically got personal slaves to take care of them They never had to ask for anything the waitress was hovering over their table every 3 minutes nnThe service pissed me off and I would never go back even though their sushi is pretty goodThis is a no frill authentic Japanese restaurant that is generally filled with Japanese and other Asians If you are looking to order fancy drinks and Americanized California rolls this is not the place for you Go to Nikko in South End for the Upscale experience and super expensive SushinnI believe this is now the only place in Charlotte where you can order really good Bento Boxes and authentic Ramen Noodle bowls Mai Japanese Restaurant used to have good Bento boxes when they were at South Blvd location but they have abandoned Bento Box since they have moved to Colony Road location  nnSushi here are very fresh and there are plenty of Japanese appetizers on the menu in English and Japanese The service is typical of small family run restaurant  They tend to get overwhelm when it is too busy  nnMango Mochi is our children favorite dessert We try to go here once or twice a monthMy girlfriend and I have been coming here for a while now Finally leaving a review for this awesome Japanese restaurant Ive tried just about everything on the menu and Musashi never disappoints If you authentic Japanese ramen and not the ramen fusion thats around town you have to come here its top notch Their sushi is spot on and you cant go wrong with their bento box offerings We come here at least once a week so goodMy wife and i dine in here for dinner First off they do not keep in track of first in first serve We kind of had to guess who is next Also order 1 bottle of sake and  2 chirashi dinner which costed 2199 each And they gave us soo little sashimi and portions did match the price And the lady didnt even give us water for frist 15mins and before we even finished eat she handed us a check Not even buffet places hand yoh5check before u ask And we didnt even stay more than 40mins total And didnt want to stay any longer I would give this place 0 star if i couldBest place for authentic AsianJapanese food Must try the ramen bowl and bento box Great sushi tooI used to visit Japan often to meet customers Ive eaten at Rameen places where a bowl costs 4 and is a full meal to the fancy sushi places that are Gaijin traps where prices can run to over 100 per head easily for a good mealnnMusashi is an unpretentious genuine Japanese place that bring back the best of authentic Japanese food to me Except for the Sushi The only Sushi Ive liked here is the Ikura Of course they have some rolls on the menu for the Gaijin  which made me sceptical when I first visited But a quick Sumimasen did the trick and I got good advice on what is best on the menu Got chided on my 2nd visit for drinking Sake for lunch but explained that my friend had never had tried it They were most welcoming of me when I came on my own and I was most embarrassed and ignored by them when I visited this place with my girlfriend  because she is exactly the sort of Gaijin whod insist on ordering Sushi rolls and ignore their wonderful Tonkatsu rameennnSo to cut it short this is a place only if you like genuine Japanese holeinthewall kind of places If you are looking strictly for Sushi Id still recommend the Tamago and the Ikura over any other place within 100 milesI love this restaurant  The best Japanese menu in the city  It is not trendy or fusion  just good traditional Japanese family restaurant foodLunch ReviewnnWe pulled up at 1145 am to discover that they didnt open till 12 for lunch We waited patiently in the car At 12 pm the sign flipped to open and a people started emerging from their car to walk in The restaurant itself is pretty tiny There were a few booths two small 2top tables a few larger tables pushed together and a separate traditional dining area for larger partiesnnThey had their lunch special A and lunch special B out to view on a table near the register I ordered the lunch special A  rice with beef on top and a smaller bowl of pork ramen The beau ordered the miso ramen Overall I enjoyed my food and he enjoyed his It really wasnt anything to rave about though Pretty standard Definitely not the best ramen Ive had but hey It was Charlotte good nnA few things I found annoying The floors were slightly sticky feeling and the service was curt at best I wont be going out of my way to return unless i have a huge hankering for ramenI went at about 630p on a Monday The service was prompt and courteous I wasnt rushed I thoroughly enjoyed the umeshiso maki with an entrxc3xa8e  of katsujyu and miso soup Ill be back with friends and family

place has the unfortunate distinction of serving up the worst toro Ive ever hadinstead of butter I got coal  That aside the sashimi is serviceable and generally as fresh as Charlotte gets  The specials will almost always be a fantastic deal You will always have two options to choose fromand while people may hold subconscious grudges against the letter B I can assure you that electing special B will not detract from your dining experience whatsoever  My parents and sister love the mackerel here if thats your thing I have too many bad memories of those fermented fishies in rancid tomato paste to really care for it outside of raw sashimi slivers  For those attempting to beat back the oppressive curtain that is the Charlotte summer Musashi is one of the few places here that serves up a refreshing plate of chewy zaru soba nnI also remember the wines being spelled super weirdly  Like Kabernet Sabignykind of weird  That was sort of endearingnnOf course its plagued by the same service problems and dour server expressions that other Asian restaurants have which still can be a bit of a shock in the land of sunshine and Southern hospitalityMusashi is by far the best Japanese Restaurant nnMy choices are from the appetizer are nnShrimp Shumai Steamed shrimp dumplings and Shrimp Tempura Lightly battered fried shrimp  vegetable  yes I order these two items for my appetizer every time we come  I dont care it was an amazing flavor real Japanese style Shumai and Tempura it is a perfection nnThen I would then order my favorite soup  nnTonkotsu Pork bone base  Japanese egg noodle w roasted pork slices bamboo shoot  green onions Cant complete the heavenly dinner without my favorite soupnnnand for the Main nnThe bento box is the best option You could choose from chicken beef or pork or salmon nnI always choose either Chicken or Beef Teriyaki but the best thing about BENTO BOX is that it has everything in it pretty much maybe pricey but it is worth the  paid for because it was damn excellentMy favorite authentic Japanese food in town Its a small family owned restaurant Love their lunch specials They usually have two or three different lunch specials every day with generous portion at a very reasonable price Every dish from agedashi tofu tonkasudon ramen nabeyaki udon to cold soba with tempura is simply deliciousIve been going to this place from the beginning This is TRUE Japanese food Ramen Curry Sushi etc is authentic and not made like youd get at a asian fusion place Id say if you come with an open mind about the sushi youd like it otherwise stick with the Ramen and Gyoza cant go wrong there nnService can be a bit scattered but everyone is very friendly this is a family owned restaurant so its not always ran efficiently But in the end you come to a restaurant for the food not the great service ala Peter Lugers With that said everyone that has worked in their is quite friendlyThe food is better than average and affordably priced but service is extremely slow and theres no rhyme or reason as to when dishes come out of the kitchen  They dont answer their phone any time of day and dont return calls so its nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement  nnBut its a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4  Thats probably their focal point anyway  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad if expensive sake selection  nnI would immediately give them four or even five stars if service was a little more organized and purposeful and if the staff could be significantly friendlier  There are only two servers even on Saturday nights during prime time so perhaps that is the source of the problem anyway  Be prepared for long waits during your meal if you go with a group of 5 or moreMusashi is my favorite spot in Charlotte for authentic ramen or a bento box lunch The sushi is also good  the fish is always fresh and the portions are generous The servers never have much to say but I cant complain since service is fast and Im there for the food The BEST service Ive had in a long time All of our food was made to order I just loved that The inside is small the staff is friendly and the prices are greatMy family has been a repeat customer and huge fans of this place for as long as I can remember  I really dont think you can go wrong with anything on this menu the food is authentic as so many people have said below and doesnt disappoint  The setup of the restaurant is nice and the servers are extremely nice and friendly  I love a good bento box or bowl of ramen from here  And out of all the sushi Ive ever had theirs is definitely at or at least very near the top of my list  You can always count on this place for a satisfying lunch or dinnerTerrible  Very disappointing We went for ramen and it was very plain and tasteless  Hard boiled egg instead of pickled  Dry pork instead of pork belly Asked if they could make just a plate of noodles for our 3 year old and she said no  We dont have noodles  Well what is in your ramen  Services was just plain rudeVery authentic japanese restaurant  We ordered curry rice sushi dinner a ramen and katsu don  And some appetizersnnSushi rolls the right way katsu tastes like authentic and agedashi was good toonnGyoza was excellent something I havent had the best for long time  You can tell they are home madennCurry I m suspecting that they use the curry blocks you buy from market but nonetheless it tastes good  But its pricey for its servingnnRamen is still not the best I had  They use lean pork  The broth is just ok  The whole thing is average but not overly disappointed  I m a big fan of ramen and I rate this over yama in midwood and futo buta  Need to try the yume bistro nextAwesome sushi great environment only two servers and yet they still managed to help us and get us everything on time amazing place definitely coming backCame back for Ramen and so very glad I did This place had some absolutely delicious ramen that was flavored and cooked to perfection I am not a ramen expert but its the best Ive had in Charlotte nnAgain their other food is good and authentic and while I originally said I wasnt blown away I feel like it might be a slight injustice The food at Musashis is made to be good Its kind of like when your mom or grandmother cooks You know you love it and it tastes amazing to you but its not something you see in a fancier establishment so you dont feel impressed However it is exactly that good and tastes great and thats what you get from MusashisSo happy to find this place in Charlotte  I never thought I would find authentic Japanese food made by Japanese in North Carolina  And its really good too  I had some of the best Tonkatsu ever and my mom is Japanese  My husband had the Chicken Katsu which was breast and is always a plus  He said it was so tender and crispy  I also had the Ika Karaage which was fried crispy yet was not tough at all  I cant wait to go back and try something else  nnService was fast for a small place  They all work together as a team and it showsA group of friends and I had a great time at Musashi  We were in the elevated room with floor seating  I have not had traditional ramen soup before  it was great  I think we were probably a little much for the typical crowd there so maybe dont show up with a ton of bros in towAuthentic Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location Fresh and generously sliced sashimi lightly breaded tempura done right not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp flavorful ramen and noodles and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes including the light misobased salad dressing We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers tofu was divinenot overly cooked then a sashimi platter a ramen an udon a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly wkimchee dish an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe its a Korean dish but wonderfully prepared nevertheless None of the dishes were too sauceheavy or overly fried and the soupsbroths were not too salty As a result you could actually taste the foodwhat a conceptIm a Japanophile myself and I LOVE Musashi As far as I know it is the only place to find real authentic Japanese food in the Charlotte area It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional usually for big parties To most the staff doesnt seem so friendly which I think is a standard Japanese way of just staying out of your way For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba  which was great I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic Japanese environment The only setback is that I live so far from itWe have been here a couple of times with overall good experience I would recommend people try everything my Japanese coworker told Musashi might be the best Japanese in townlolJust like youre in Japan  Food is fantastic and 100 authentic  Prices are great for lunch normal for dinner  Be sure to check the A and B lunch choices when you walk in  Theyre always displayed up front with plastic wrap on themnnSome things to expect that are a little uniquenClosed on TuesdaynDoesnt open until 12pm closed between lunch and dinnernOrders come out when ready for each person not all at oncenSmall restaurant normally pretty crowdedGreat traditional Japanese spot If you want to taste more than sushi and discover the greatness of Japanese cuisine his is the right place nLunch specials filling and affordable friendly servers It gets busy most days bc is good and a small restaurant so be patient and e joy your foodIf you want authentic Japanese come here I absolutely love Sue and the sushi chef They are so sweet and awesome Great Japanese food Nice decor cute place very great service The miso and pork bone ramen were really good but just a little bit more expensive than what Im used toThis is as close as it gets in this town Good variety of standards and super friendly environmentThis place has delicious authentic Japanese ramen The gyoza are delicious I always get the pork ramen tonkatsu A bowl of happiness  I have yet to try their sushi or teriyaki  but it looks so good It is always full of happy customers I love MusashiI hate to give a bad review on a rare restaurant thats actually run by Japanese people apparently but it just wasnt a good food The sushi set I ordered was a typical Americanized sushi affair Not authentic at allnnI also dont know where they find their cooks but I seriously doubt the Japanese guy behind the sushi counter was properly trained in the sushi making at least not in Japan Just because the guy is a Japanese doesnt make him any kind of sushi master Its a profession not a nationality He also was very slow in making his sushis I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter Not only he doesnt seem like a proper sushi cook his workattitude was not professional at all They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customersWe were there around 6PM the place was empty  I had second doubt about this place since it was situated in a questionable location We were greeted by an older lady assuming she was the owner not the warmest greeting we had ever received Few minutes had passed the server came to take our drink order We ordered large hot sake  a bottle of Sapporo The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave Fine I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer maybe the sake machine wasnt turn on We ordered edamame  fried squid legs They were both just ok nothing really stood out For the main course we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen  a sushi roll For the ramen this is legit  The broth is light  rich not thick like other place Only complaint was an overcooked egg The roll  Wife ate all of it since it had eel  I didnt really care for  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro ika hamachi spider roll futo maki Nothing was short of excellence  Dont mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish the quality was out of this world This had to be the best quality we ever had if you look at my review we had also tried Nobus Aspen You know we are foodies We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total all of which were the best Overall if you rate this place less than 5 stars you are crazyI really enjoy Japanese food and had heard how authentic Musashi was Well that is true It is authentic and just as bland as some of the Japanese restaurants in Japan The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory It just had no spice at all to it Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it it became a decent meal If this was available at pho prices I would be back However with that dish costing 15 Id rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at homeAfter hearing my dad rave about this place we decided to do his birthday dinner here He doesnt rave about anything which means it has to be good He used to work for a Japanese company and they would frequent this place after work nnIm a Japanese food novice so I let my dad order everything Their menu is simple and so is their layout Just two ladies were serving a packed restaurant and they really kept up quite well But you dont care about that THE FOOD WAS AMAZING Im excited to add Musashi to my regular rotationFirstly this is one of rare few actual Japanese restaurants operated by Japanese people This is the closest experience you will get in the CharlottePineville area as if you were served in Japan Ive had their Udon  cold Soba Noodles and they are both delicious It make me feel as if I was back in Japan They are well know for their bento box chicken Katsu nnIf you strive for an accurate Japanese food experience then look no furtherSo this place comes highly recommended It is behind my favorite ThaiVietnamese place VietThai and once night we thought wed check it outnnWe had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken Everything was good but I wasnt blown away I really wish the salad had a ginger dressing and I  may ask if they have it next time but it has a sesame dressing I hear they have the best Ramen in town and over half of the patrons were japanese That speaks volumes  FYI he loved the place but didnt think his chicken was the best We both agreed wed be back to try the Ramen and UdonI really enjoyed my dinner crazy tuna roll and a smoked salmon nigiri that made me so happy I became lonesome once I realized I had eaten it alreadynnAs soon as we walked in there was a super adorable lady ready to tend to us nnEveryone was very attentive and amiable Im a very satisfied customernnThe place is very small but very nice and clean I plan on coming backPretty tasty and very authentic For some reason it was white guyAsian wife night plus kids Good thing my hubs and I fit in Also I need to brush up on my Japanese so I can read the secret menuNot a place to die for  good sushi place is hard to come by in Charlotte especially in the Ballantyne area  Fish here is ok not much selection  Noodle tastes like the ones from package  But the cutlets are good had it few times  had their bento box disappointed by the portion they give you and the price they charge made me feel like I was paying the NYC priceI found this restaurant through Yelp and I saw that people really liked the ramen Now I have been to Japan and the best ramen I have had in the US was in DC I was not sure what to expect when we went to Musashi From the outside it looked like a cheap place with maybe adequate sushi The inside was a whole different story It felt genuine and warm All the food items sounded delicious Nothing was too salty or greasy The stuff we ordered tasted great I got the miso ramen which was super flavorful The tempura shrimp was very juicy It was not like some restaurants where the fried part overpowers the taste of the actual food Definitely try out this restaurant4 years later since my initial review and nothing has changed I love love love Musashi I highly recommend coming here for lunch which for me means my Saturday lunches are usually here They usually do 3 specialty lunch boxes Box A B and C A is usually a unique homemadeesque Japanese dish Sometimes it is katsu curry Other times it is ramen Sometimes its a little of both and other times its a bento box Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl My usually order the A as it is always unique authentic and delicious Other recommendations are katsudon katsu with egg and onions over rice grilled mackerel chicken katsu and agedashi tofuFirst off we WILL return  This place is pretty solid on humble authentic atmosphere and recipepresentation  It is obviously a favorite of the JapaneseAmerican population of CharlottennAfter many good Yelpers guided us to this spot we decided finally to give it a try  A busy spot and a small restaurant  It did not appear that they took reservations Im not sure  There are two American style kotatsu tables that appear to seat up to six  Dress in layers this tiny joint gets cozynnWe plan to try more sushi varieties its right in line with prices from other places  Its very fresh straightforward presentation  Timing on food coming out is decent we didnt wait forever  We had a couple of rolls and they were good  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive  My 11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting  Next time I will probably try a bento box  My husband had the tonkatsu ramen and was pretty satisfiednnThe service staff is so very nice and cheerful  If you know Japanese my husband does they love to make conversationWent to this place to order the Ramen that everyone has raved aboutits too bad that I could not focus on enjoying the ramen because the place was just too dirty and grimy I sat in a booth close to the wall and thought for sure I would catch a fungus just by sitting too close to the dirty wall The table was also sticky and gross  There sanitation score was a 90 and something tells me thats pretty high for them The ramen was just okbut I think if you cant properly clean your tables and your walls  that something even more disgusting disturbing and dirty is lurking in the kitchen  I was not impressed and will never go backMy husband and I lived in Shanghai and have traveled to Japan several times We knew the moment we walked in that this place was legit One menu only in Japanese very traditional decor and fantastic food So happy to have true taste of home for us here in Charlotte We moved to Charlotte in Summer 2013 and we are so blessed to find this restaurant I worked for a Japanese company and I have taken several Japanese guests to this place All of them claimed that the dishes are very original and they felt that they are in TokyonnOur family eats at this place once a week Chirazi sushi Agedashi tofu tonkatsu and ramenudon are our typical orderI was long anticipating going to Musashi to try the BBQ eel It was the only place I could find that had bbq eel however it was only ok especially for 20 It came with a miso soup and was served on white rice nothing special Service was fast for takeout I am willing to try again and want to try the ramen not available for takeout But right now Im not overly impressedGood Japanese food The ramen is really good Curry with pork chop is also my favorite Lunch time food is decent Weekend night could be crowded and you should expect long wait timeSo far Ive only had the ramen but it is so delicious Honestly I started craving real restaurant ramen while I was watching Naruto and it was as good as I could have imagined and Im so glad I found a place thats in the area I also tried their steamed dumplings as an appetizer and they tasted incredibly freshMy boyfriend and I loved this place We both love authentic oriental food and this is at the top of the list now The people were all great fast servers and the food was delicious nnSome highlights to our meal wa the miso soup not made from a packet and the sushi This will definitely be a new regular place for usnnMake sure to get there early because it is a small location and fills up quickly in the eveningSo I came in for 1 thing the eel bowl Thats what I got and thats all I got I expected it to be served with wasabi or ginger but nope literally eel and rice I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce they didnt have any I was kind of disappointed Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers What it all really boils down to is how good is that eel Let me tell you its one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things Ive put in my mouth The eel was cut to perfection huge portions might I add In fact its hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that arent cut up Because it was cooked whole it makes the eel that much more tender If youve never had eel you must try it It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia grilled with eel sauce and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness nBut seriously I need shrimp sauce or white sauce Next time I may order it Togo and get shrimp sauce from somewhere else Problem solvedI think my expectations were a little to high on this one I was looking for some good ramen and decided to drive across town to Musashi Unfortunately I was not thrilled with the ramen there It was not bad but not what I was looking for I also ordered a spicy tuna roll The roll was overpowered by mayo and was not for me The service however was good and the staff was friendly Just to many other better sushi places around townI asked the cashier at Hatoya for an authentic Japanese restaurant she gave me MusashinnMy friend and I immediately wanted to check the restaurant out only to find out that they open at 530pm  We came back at 635pmnnPlace  The establishment is small but gosh it was packed on a Friday night at 645pm One thing I have learned is to make reservations It looked like almost more than half of the tables had Reserved signs  There were people behind us waiting for a table some leftnnFood n Tonkotsu Ramen I was craving for some ramen and the ramen I had ordered was alright I was hoping for the one I had tried in NewYork or the one in Houston  The flavor of the pork Tonkotsu Ramen was there but just missed the mark on presentation and other ingredients Definitely better than the others I have been to around Charlotte n Tonkatsu Bento Box My friends husband loved his bento Tonkatsu box n Katsu Chicken Entree My husband had the Katsu Chicken and it was alright  n Salad The salad ginger peanut dressing was goodn Off the menu Shrimp Tempura Roll Just shrimp tempura and the roll no other veggies  whatnnService  They are good about getting to you when you ask for their service  When they are busy it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to younnPrice  Was alright not too shabby and reasonable at best nnSo bottom line I like the food but I am in no dire need to come back I would be happy to have their food at the Japanese Festival though   I felt bad for the people who waited around the door for the next available seattable  My friends and I quickly paid for our dinner after we were done so they could be seatedVery enjoyable evening  Fantastic service by the wait staff and entertaining performance by the chef  Would recomend for a good change of pace from the normWhenever I am in Charlotte I practically BEG my friends to take me to Musashi For three years I have gone to this Japanese Restaurant for their Miso Ramen and croquettes Both of which are truly amazing Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it and the broth is fantasticnnMy last visit which was last Thursday I finally got to sample their sushi I have some Unagi BBQed Eel and some Ebi Cooked shrimp with some vinegar I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful The Ebi had the perfect amount of vinegar taste to it and the Unagi had a wonderful BBQ sauce on it The green tea they serve is always hot and a great way to compliment any mealnnThe atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional Japanese Restaurant it is closed off by some sliding doors It also has  a hole under the table for you to place your legs when you sit  The rest of the restaurant is brightly lit and a cozy feel to itnnThe Staff is always friendly and kind and you really could not ask for any better They always feel very attentive to their customers If your glass of tea is nearly empty someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill itnnMusashi is my favorite Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina It is a shame it is so far away from me but its worth the trip when I am in the area if you are looking for some fantastic sushi tempura or ramen this is the place to goThis is a completely legit traditional Japaneseowned sushi restaurant which is a bit of a rarity anywhere in the United States outside of a major city like NY LA Chicago DC or Miami let alone North Carolina There are fancier LOOKING sushi places to be found in this town for sure but purist Japanese sushi that caters to a very Japanese and Asian crowd Youd be hard pressed to find more than a few of these at allnnThe lunch special is great especially the Chirashi Sushi which is pieces of sashimi on top of a bowl of seasoned sushi rice The tempura appetizer is perfect with just the right amount of coating and a real ponzu dipping sauce with daikon radish in it nnThis is not a place for fancy Americanized rolls Order traditional stuff or just watch what the regulars are eatingMy favorite authentic Japanese food in town Its a small family owned restaurant Love their lunch specials They usually have two or three different lunch specials every day with generous portion at a very reasonable price Every dish from agedashi tofu tonkasudon ramen nabeyaki udon to cold soba with tempura is simply deliciousAfter a visit to San Francisco Chinatown to eat Ramen noodles I had a huge craving for real ramen noodles  A friend of mine recommended Musashi as an authentic Japanese restaurant so I decided to give it a trynnI ordered the udon noodle soup and it was almost what I remember eating in San Francisco  I also ordered a small roll just to try the sushi   Both were excellent  nnIts great that we can get authentic Japanese food in Charlotte  I just wish it wasnt such a drive for meVery authentic for the area   However I wouldnt exactly call this 100 authentic   It is definitely the most authentic weve had in NC   There was a line out the door and only one server so we waited over 20 minutes before even speaking to someone  We were seated but only received one menu so we shared it   We were served after four other tables that arrived after us  We ordered tea and water and our server forgot my tea  The tea seems powdered   Husband got Shoyu Ramen and I wanted chicken katsu curry but the chicken katsu is 8 apparently its five additional dollars for the curry sauce  So i ordered the Tempura instead   It was very good  We also got pork shumai but there was hard bone bits my husband almost cracked his tooth on and the consistency of the rest of the shumai was complete mush  The gyoza I recieved with my Tempura was very good   We ordered an additional side of gyoza and those came with barely any sauce and were burned black on the bottom  His noodles were very good firm stretchy chewy delicious   Very good flavor in the broth  nnWe will be back to give this place another shot they just seemed a bit too busy and a little understaffed  Also we wont order the shumai again it just didnt seem right to usMusashis is our go to spot for authentic Japanese The staff is owned and run by a Japanese family  huge plus especially nowadays where youve got all these japanese restaurants run by Chinese Korean or the East Asian people Its always a good sign when you see other Japanese diners dining there The ambience is simple and unassuming allowing the food to speak for itself The food here is AUTHENTIC The sushi chef is intimidating looking and very serious about what he does The sushi and sashimi are all very good  chirashi bowl sashimi a la carte uni yellowtail salmon roe salmon tuna Their rolls taste fantastic too We always go with the spicy yellowtail Cali rolls and soft shell crab with avocado Their cooked items are delicious too grilled mackerel and fried squid legs apps any of their ramen and udon bowls or their soba noodles Pair any of these items with some sake or beernnFYI  They take reservations and have a large separate room shoes must be taken off with two tables that can seat 810 ppl each For these tables you sit on the floor and legs can hang below They have set lunch and dinner hours and never pick up the phone unless theyre open and not too busy They open at 530 for dinner and weve arrived at 515 to see a line outsidennHave an urge for some quality and authentic Japanese in Charlotte Look no furtherI have been going here for too many years to count and it is hands down the most authentic Japanese restaurant that exsists here This is not American Style Japanese this is REAL YUMMY JAPANESE FOODI figure Id add to this review too my sister michelle r here on Yelp already wrote a great review and I just wanted to say that I agree with her that this place is really authentic  I come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials  If not the special yes the katsudon is delicious served w rice and onions and an egg on top  So are their bento boxes Ill usually order their grilled mackerel  And yes their sushi is also really good  My only complaint would be that its a little small and it can get too crowded and busy when that happens Ill go to the other Japanese restaurant right around the cornerSome of the most authentic Japanese food Ive eaten in terms of ramen pork cutlets and bento boxs nnThe prices at lunch are definitely reasonable especially for the ramen and the bento boxs but my last visit I indulged in some pork cutlets and miso ramen The cutlets were perfectly cooked having a crispy outer layer from the Panko and a firm but succulent interiornnThe ramen never fails to disappoint and even though I may have gotten the miso ramen this time around the shoyu ramen soy sauce ramen is definitely one of my favorites at MusashiWaiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before It was rather salty instead  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback In any case Im not giving Musashi up yet since its close to home cookingnnMmm at least the ika on the nigiri is thick and the uni on the nigiri is two pieces on one nigiri And I hv lotsa of tuna on my tekkadon Only thing tho the Saba on the nigiri was salty Never had a salty Saba before nnThird cup of green tea YummmThe Pork Ramen is indeed delicious as are the Sushi Gyoza  Shrimp Tempura Handsdown the most authentic Japanese restaurant in South Charlotte Highly recommendedAlright this sushi place reminds me of Mr Miyagi in Houston TXwhich run by a husband n wife teamnnI must eaten here 100th times  or more already but never actually write a review for itnnAgain these private asian restaurants are not known for customer services but I always had great service whenever I ate hereso dine with an open mind and dont expect to be treat like queen or kingnnTheir fishes are always on pointwhen you eat a sushi roll or chirashi bowl it should blend together and give you a satisfying tastennIf you eat sashimi and the restaurant serve you with ice underneath then just leave cuz they dont know what the hell theyre doingnnYes they deserve all 5 stars for their foodsAfter a just okay visit to Yama last week the fella convinced me to try the best sushi in Charlotte at Musashi  Im not a sushi fan but I can eat teriyaki chicken and veggies anywhere  He said he hadnt been in years and was curious to see if they were still as awesome as he remembered  They were  He got 4 or 5 different types of rolls and all were good but he said octopus is one of the best tests of sushi  He said it was a smidgen chewy but its octopus  The teriyaki chicken was good but it came with soup salad and egg salad no grilled veggies like Im used to  It was tasty though  nnOur young waiter was super nice and accommodating this Asian food nerd needed a fork and he even bowed to say thank you when we left  I wouldve never tried this place without the fellas suggestion since its in a strip mall and the sign wasnt even lit when we got there but it was very warm inviting and unassuming with great foodI had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 830pm and were the only souls in the place Let me also say how hard it was to find this place Granted it was raining and dark but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this stripsuite mall I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold rainy night and it sounded very comfortable like memories from college days The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles I dont eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate Overall the ramen tasted good but there could have been much more noodles and less broth This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent Overall this place was just ok I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggiesWe had high expectations because the first time we came here they were pack full and we didnt want to wait for a table so went somewhere else  We came back today and right at the beginning the service was terrible  The older lady looks like she hated life and was rude  The other servers seemed okay but the main one that took care of us was awful  Food was okay  When does it become acceptable to give bad serviceI havent had Japanese food this amazing since high school Amazing absolutely amazing food it felt like I was being welcomed into a homeMy wife and I dont normally go to Japanese restaurants because we dont know too much about them How ever  going to this restaurant was a delightful experience  familyorientated  sushi bar service and full service table dining  staff was very attentive  It was crowded about 90 Japanese so that kind of tells you the quality of food served there  we will go there againThis place is amazing  But if youre looking for hibachi and white sauce this isnt youre place This is authentic and I love it They dont even have white sauce hereMusashi holds a special place in my heart and I cant believe I havent blown up their yelp page with my review This restaurant is familyowned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years Musashi has and will always be my goto place for simple fresh and authentic No sizzing grill no fancy chefs or crazy tricks just the core of Japanese cuisine nnSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday Ive been craving their sashimi for weeks They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more Salmon is my favorite Trust me I kept yearning for a chance to go back If youre more adventurous I recommend the beef tongue If youve never had beef tongue it is soft yet slightly chewy The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth I dont think its on the menu but you can always ask the friendly staff Sadly they ran out on this occasion Weve also tried the Fukahire Salad marinated shark finjelly fish salad grilled sardines and a few other appetizers but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers What can I say were some adventurous eatersnnNow for the main course My absolute favorite is the Katsujyu which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions served over a bed of rice A jyu box is actually the Japaneses traditional method of presenting food how cool If youre not much of a pork fan I would go with the Chickenkatsu If youre in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle roasted pork slices bamboo shoot and green onions Yummm this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp saucennBefore I talk about dessert I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost Im glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture Ready for the end of this food adventure Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect mealThis review is a long time a comin but here it is either way In my first few months I found myself in Charlotte all alone on Yom Kippur which is the jewish holiday where we fast for the entire day thats right an entire day Basically the entire day you dream about what you are going ot eat for dinner which makes it even more excruciating By 8pm 15 hours past sun down I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier she had told me of a secret japanese menu and fresh fishnnWell I can tell you this place has BOTH And the best part is the head chef there and owner is quite japanese and began his career in my home citys Toronto first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s Suffice to say I was pretty sold after talking to this guy nnThe japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot not sure what the name of that is  they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but Ive been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item nnProbably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru yet to try new zealand which i also heard was greatI finally found some legitimate tonkotsu ramen in Charlotte It wasnt bland or watery and the pork chashu was savory and delicious I would definitely come back though it is a little far out from the city 20 min drivennYoull notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home Theres a private dining room which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats sliding doors and pillowsThe owners are also japanese which is always a good sign in my books if youre looking for some lipsmacking ramen nnThe menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan ranging from potato croquettes with the delicious bulldog brand sauce to gyoza and even mini fried crabs Ramen is by far the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths soy miso tonkotsu etcnnThe process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almostcreamy texture of the broth filled with the rich flavor of pork The soup also has a great milkycolor Unfortunately the noodles arent hand made and you can tell theyre more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles However this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl I didnt leave one dropnnThe restaurant serves alcohol but not past a certain hour like 9 or 10 so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki Perfect accompaniment to dinner Prices are very reasonable and the hospitality is fantastic Food is served in a timely fashion and everything tastes phenomenal nnIm already looking forward to the next time I come backnn45It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese Well Musashi is one such place The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone Good authentic menu service and foodThis is the only place to go for Japanese food in Charlotte We are regulars so we are treated very well I dont know what the others complain aboutthe service seems very good to me The food is greatAn adorable family owned restaurant This small Japanese serves a traditional Japanese meal that keeps you coming back for more A must try Arrived party of 6 on a Wednesday night Host would not acknowledge our presence wasted 30 mins of our time figuring out whether we could get a table or notnnTerrible serviceReman was good but the sashimi I ordered was hard do describe  It doesnt look very fresh the cut is not clear and its the first time I know that tuna sashimi can be chewyThis restaurant is nestled in a little shopping center but dont let the locale deceive you The food here is outstanding  I got a musashi bento box probably should have went lighter on the soup and salad I had beforehand with some sort of citrusy wine Everything was excellent  it looks to be a familyowned business as well and it shows with the excellent and courteous service of course the place is usually busy so dont come here expecting fast food but our order arrived within reasonable time Do check this place outIve only been here once but this place impressed me The service was a bit slow but the Lunch Special A I had was very very tasty Well the ramen had somewhat of a weird taste in the soup but the katsu don served over rice wasIve never had better katsu don I would eat it again Most sushi restaurants Ive gone to were owned by Koreans or Americans but I think this place is authentically Japanese including the workers and owner Definitely recommend itIt took a few visits before I felt comfortable with the staff at Musashi  I dont think theyre intentionally unfriendly they just dont go that extra mile Once you get to know them though from waitstaff to sushi chef to kitchen guy  theyre super nice But lets get to the real reason why you should go to this place  the food I think its the most legit Japanese in Charlotte primarily because the place is dominated by Japanese patronsnnAgedashi Tofu  broth is to die for and the tofu so  delicately breadednSea Snails  one again boiledsteamed in sake and the shells put out a delicious broth on their own Texture similar to conchnDumplings  I usually dont love dumplings in Japanese restaurants but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an ordernnSushiSashimi is outstanding  they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonablenSobaUdon  delicious noodles and clear or dark brothhavent tried the cold Soba but thats my next step nnThere is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that nonGaijin menu She said she would be happy to do sonnTo heck with the strip mall atmosphere  this is just a great little gem in South Charlotte for sushi lovers who dont want to dress up like theyre going clubbing dont want disco balls and sake bombs sorry Nikko and EnsoWords cant express how good this place is fo authentic SushinnIt opens at 530 we get there at 515 and theres a line  Everytime Dont let the looks fool youWell here goes my first review to chronicle my lifelong love affair with food I had in mind trying something new because how awfully long some reviews turn out to be  kinda like the length of this introduction So bottomline Im going to begin with a five words or less review nnAuthentic Attentive Explore the appetizersnnThis place fills me with nostalgia The menu selection and execution remind me of my moms dishes and the local mom  pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of JapannnYou wont get a show with your teppan yaki but what you will get is authentic and delicious Japanese food nnIf you are looking to get past the more well known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food Id recommend the agedashi dofu grilled mackerel get a side of rice with it and nabe udon nnAll in all after three times here Ive left with a feeling of happiness  due to some part of not having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market  that hasnt surfaced in quite some time even back home in Long Beach CAnnThe only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen The broth needs some work nn5 starsSimple No sushi in Charlotte at this point beats them Ask for Bunta and the Japanese menu We have been eating there for years Rusan himself eats there We ran into him going in to eat one nightIf you go for lunch I recommend getting either A or B They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out It is such a good deal you only pay about 8 bucks for either box The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi 6 regular rolls 2 larger ones 2 slices of sashimi on rice some kind of mayo based salad miso soup and peanut sauce salad Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup although it can vary many days Both are mouth wateringn     For dinner I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle It is awesome it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful You cannot take this to go so be sure to finish it It has egg and lots of vegetables and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion Other things I enjoy are the pork katsudon ramen curry katsu and the agedashi dofu is excellent Really no matter what you pick you cant go wrong n    On a rare occasion most likely in the winter be sure to check out the sushi specials If they have TORO tunafatty tuna be sure to get it without any questions and do not get the roll just get the whole slab Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth Worth every pennyn    Overall Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place But when the food is that good it doesnt really matter It doesnt have any of the overthetop sushi roll specials but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly cooked rice It is the most authentic Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come acrossToday I had an absolutely horrible experience at Musashi Japanese restaurant on Johnston Road CharlottenWaitress were impolite unfriendly wearing some dirty shoes which should be already a red flag sign but I was hungry and I thought not a big deal Well it turned out to be a big dealnWhere are the traditional appropriate for any type of services smiles Where is the traditional Japanese hospitality you see in other restaurants It was anything like thatn When a hostess found out that I am alone she set me at the small uncomfortable table while the restaurant was nearly empty nI asked to be seated at another table and hostess started arguing I repeat the restaurant was nearly empty and who says if you come alone you dont deserve a better seatnI looked at the menu and asked questions about some dishes but waitresses did not speak English and they could not explain me anythingnI ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI The dish looked very unattractive big chunks of lettuce and  potato salad which I did not order and nobody asked me if I want one on a side the taste was even worse I ate CHICKEN TERIYAKI in many other Japanese restaurants before and this is a delicious dish but not in this terrible placenOn the top of that I saw a bug crawling across the table I killed it and I called a manager Waitress started arguing with me again nI did not see any smiles and I did not hear Im sorry Waitresshostess was rudenI felt sick after that ordealnI could not touch my meal and I left this nasty bugs infested place hungry and frustrated about a horrible experience and my wasted timennI would rate this place the worst ratingMusashi was an overall great experience The restaurant is quaintwarm and cozy I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli fried rice and shrimp sauce The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing The chicken teriyaki was served with soupsalad rice and noodles The most outstanding part was the service They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of I highly recommend itThis place has nice tonkotsu ramen The broth is creamy rich and it looks like they invest a lot of time producing the broth If youre around the area and cant find a nice ramenyasan to go to come here and enjoy a warm bowl of ramenNot exactly sure how this restaurant got so many 5 reviews Without any other restaurants in the area that serve anything japanese besides sushi Its great that they serve ramen and tonkatsu but they were only fair Unfortunately the service suffered too as they are understaffed nnThis place has potential but I will probably not be coming back for a whileWhere should start Parking is abundant in this tiny strip of stores Musashi is from what Ive experienced is an authentic Japanesefamilyrun establishment Having Japanese parents and having lived in Nara for a part of my life I longed for the real Japanese taste in food U can taste it in their Miso soup made with dashi U can taste it in their croquette dipped in tonkatsu sauce Mmmm When I check out a new Japanese restaurant I always go for the chirashi to see what hidden treasure I might discover and boy I think I had MIRUGAI in it I dont think I was dreaming  Back in Japan I missed the chirashi which had unique sashimi pieces like even awabi This natsukashii omoi Arigatoo Musashi I will be back most certainly It is not a fancy restaurant Its portions do not speak in volume but rather in flavor If youve bn to Japanese restaurants run by Chinese you will b able to taste the difference Some people rate by volume value This is rated by aji flavor valueVery authentic Japanese food Highly recommend for anyone looking to experience real Japanese cuisine Not your typical Teriyaki or Hibachi steak kind of place For someone who lived in Japan Musashi will feel just like home And for those who hasnt it will be a rewarding experience Try the ramenProbably the only authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte They have the regular bowls and dishes served in normal every day meal not just sushi Personally I like the tonkatsu ramen and all the bento items Unagi broiled eel here is just okMixed review I was expecting more but left a bit disappointed First of all the directions from Google maps is a bit offit takes you through an apartment complex to a dead end Its located in a shopping center with Food Lion nnThe atmosphere is small with humble interior design There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions nnThe greeting was all smiles The service wasnt fast but not too slow either Our drinks were always full and the server was very friendlynnThe sushi list was limited but priced well The spicy tuna roll was very good Do not order the teriyaki chicken unless you like two marinated chicken breasts with sauce on top served with a cup of rice and a side of lettuce with ginger dressing for 12 Very disappointing The restaurant was fairly busy so Im sure they have better dishes Ill have to go back and try some of the noodle itemsI would say this place was just okay for me Nothing to amazing but the server was nice My husband did not like his sushi very much but I liked my vegetable tempura Our son did not eat most of his bento box and did not like his steak very much either  Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was just not as good a quality as they are used to either way I dont think we will be backIve seen quite a few mixed reviews of Musashi and I can honestly say that you can easily identify the two categories of reviewers those who understand Japanese culture or have been to Japan and everyone elsennIm a bit of a food purist  I feel that if you are going to eat Japanese food than it had better be at a Japanese restaurant with a Japanese chef The same can be applied to other ethnic cuisines I mean if you were on vacation in France would you honestly eat French food in France that is prepared by an American NonnRanting aside Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen Ive had since leaving Japan Period The wifes xc3xa0 la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces  the effort they put in really makes the difference nnIve seen another review here on Yelp and Ill echo it here  you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate  Dont knock them on service without understanding the culture nnIll end the review with this if you think Hibachi is Japanese food then Musashi may not be for you however if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style then look no furtherThe food and atmosphere was quite charming n Had the ramen soup and it was very light and flavorful Highly recommend to try this quaint little placeI am so thankful that this nofrills Japanese place exists I just came back from my first visit for lunch and clearly they know what their doing when it comes to noodles and soups I ordered their porkbased ramen soup with a squid salad Both easily compared to some of the best I used to enjoy back in Philadelphias Asian district This is absolutely my GoTo place in Charlotte for noodles And I cant wait until I get to visit this place againRamen and Gyoza were pretty good Ive had better Green tea ice cream was good as well Need to return to reevaluatethe ramen noodles here would be my first choice Its taste very fresh Costumer service is good The place is very smallIts an OK place for Japanese food and less than OK for sushi nnThe Agedashi tofu was very good lightly fried tofu in a light soy sauce And the cold soba noodles were good I ordered the uni and salmon nigiri and that turned out to be barely OK But what was quite offputting was the 295 cost PER piece of salmon nigiri Id expect its more like 450 to 5 for two pieces So for 295 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good its going to have to be pretty good and unfortunately Id rank it as even less than average Its soft pink nonfatty and flavorless flesh was subpar compared to what Im used to having And Ill say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion Perhaps there are things that are better choices hereWorst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time  I do not understand why this place has any stars at allnnThey were out of basic sushi like tuna etcnThe servers were rudenThree of us were there for dinner on Wednesday they brought out one persons meal then after that person was done eating they brought out the second persons meal and then after that person was done eating they brought out the last meal which was sushi so should not have taken an hournnSo each person had to eat their dinner while the other two watchednnThe sushi menu was stapled scraps of paper that looked like it was made by a kindergartner and was very limited missing even basic items like salmon roll tuna roll eel roll etc  Salmon roe Ikura was dried out so I didnt even eat it and they only gave me a half portion  The Ikura can say a lot about a place it should be wet and firm so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth  If they are sticky deflated oversalted and mushy they are no good and the pace probably isnt either nnMy brother got the pork ramen soup and said it was the worst he has ever eaten the noodles were pasty the broth had WAY too much salt etc  He said it was worse than the packaged stuffnnThe place was also dirty especially the bathroomsnnIt was a horrible experience in almost every way a place can be horrible  There is no chance we will EVER go back  Stay away from this place FAR AWAYFood is really authentic no doubt Service Not too much But I care the food more I dont expect good service in any Asian restaurantThis is THE place to go for sushi in Charlotte The service is barnone Super friendly and informative I eat a lot of sushi and this is my to go list The servers are more than happy to help teach you how to eat your food and what you are gettingnnParking is easyI had a bad experience at Musashi and wont be back I ordered the Sushi Deluxe It comes with 9 nigiri and 6 pieces of tuna roll The sushi took quite a while to come out which I am used to However it was close to room temperature That is a cause for concern with sushi The rice within the sushi was soggy I stopped about half way through the tuna rollWent here because it was very local and I wanted to try some new Jap food NEVER again will I come here again I ordered the teriyaki chicken with miso soup and the chicken tasted like they grilled Tyson chicken and literally just put teriyaki sauce on it Miso soup was ok but overall a very low review as far as the whole meal goes The customer service was great but I will still never order from here again Definitely not the kind of Japanese food I am use to from coming up NorthLove this place Niku dofu dinner only dish is one of our favorite Green bean dessert is yummyWaiting for my tekkadon I ate my miso soup but what happened to the umami flavor it had before It was rather salty instead  Wondering if the kitchen chef changed or if this is just a temporary setback In any case Im not giving Musashi up yet since its close to home cooking nn030317 A Friday DinnernDisappointed It was packed tonight Had to wait about 15 mins for a table Then had to wait 4550 for our food But the waiting wasnt the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile WRONG nnThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right  cut thick n all the same size I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA No MSG No thirst after the meal And the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco nnTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters Hmm I guess Im ole fashion n lived in Japan too long nnI also ordered three uni sashimi Hey Whats with the same price of 350 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi But I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi qualitynnWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG lots n lots nnThe tempura shrimp was perfect not doughy or undercooked nnStill since its near Im not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time nn062417 Party of four n I was the one to suggest Musashi tonight BUT my tekka don came after everyone else finished their dinner Granted its crowded tonite got but still Even the newly arrived ppl sitting next to us got their dinner b4 meAuthentic If youre looking for American sushi go somewhere else Only Authentics need apply herethis place is probably as close to authentic Japanese food as you can get in the south charlotte area its family own for quite a few years now  ive been here for lil over probably 20 times or so and everytime i go i enjoyed my food as usual its freshly cook and sushi is always fresh they use high quality ingredients as well  the place is small with lil less than 15 tables for the whole restaurant it always seems packed  the atmosphere and the decor is also nicely matched the Japanese feel Service is always good server is always smiling and very friendly she made a joke to my friends about how i will finish all the food that they dont eat if they ordered too much lol however the price is not cheap 2 entrees and a appetizer can easily run ur bill up to bout 40  tips and tax ur looking at around 50 at dinner time but u know what u get what u paid for although i cant afford eating here every week but its totally worth it when i do come with friends and family  nnon a side note REAL japanese people eat there ALL the time there is always atleast one table with japanese eating there heyif Japanese are eating japanese food here how bad can it be LOLAmazing Everything was fantastic I want to come back and hope they do a katsu curry special for lunchPlace was good  Small and very authentic which i liked  Very pleased with the placeWith Musashi as with other places I enjoy its all about the food I dont need a greeter with a plastered smile or somebody doting on me every 15 seconds If I have to wait 15 minutes for a table at Musashi thats fine cause I know the food more than makes up for itnnThat said I know this place is hit or miss My sister and I absolutely loved the place as did my Japanese roommates always ALWAYS a good sign that your Japanese roommates love the same Japanese restaurant you do But my brother and sisterinlaw werent too impressed I think Musashi is good solid Japanese food Nothing too fancy What they did they did well Their agadeshi tofu is the standard against which all other fried tofus are measured Light crisp with a flavorful but not too salty sauce The katsudon is how it should be hot eggy with just the right amount of gravy to flavor the rice There is also a special Japanese menu with snacks which make great accompaniments to beer and sake or if youre in the mood for tapas I especially like the grilled cod and the beef tongue Theres also an excellent sukiyaki The lunchtime bento boxes were also very goodnnYou gotta understand When youre living in Charlotte theres not much in the way of Japanese food And when youve been to Japan three or four times you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls Thats where Musashi comes in Theyve got more than just the same standard sushi udon teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US And they dont try to get too fancy nnAnd try to remember its all about the food Not about the lines not the lack of greeting when you enter not the crazy eyed lady who doesnt call you honey Its the foodBest Japanese restaurant Ive found in Charlotte so far Im Japanese and so I can get pretty picky with my Japanese food  I like that there is a Japanese owner and sushi chef and a menu full of authentic dishes None of that Asian fusion stuffVery good very authentic Japanese food  All of the fish was delicious On the back of some menus is a list in Japanese  ask the waiter to translate it for you and order a couple things  these were some of the most delicious items Has seating in more traditional Japanese style and also at tables For alcohol beer or sake are the way to go I cant recall if there was no wine or if the selection was just bad Subtracted one star just because the service was a bit spotty but it was very friendly and the ambiance leaves something to be desiredI have been searching Charlotte for an authentic bowl of Tonkatsu ramen when Musashi popped up on my Urbanspoon app I dragged two friends along with me who felt very uncomfortable and were confused on what to order I ordered everyones food except for the sushi lover who didnt listen to me The food was great and I finished my soup I cant wait to go backFINALLY a place to satiate my ramen needs  Potato croquette  Curry katsu There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene nnYes the previous reviews are spot on authentic Japanese minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls in a super charming space Dont be thrown off by its location next to the Little Caesars with friendly familyrun servicennThis place is packed with fellow Asians not the speedracing kind like Ru Sans which is always a good sign  nnTIP Get the lunch special A or B  Youll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant  The special is 8 and is plenty of food  Last time it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box nnTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences claiming the rolls are similar to the prepackaged ones at the supermarket and unfresh I urge you to try Musashi again I always find the rice perfect and roomtemperature and seasoned well Also to those who complain the sushi menu is small yes its less than a page  However who wants a phonebooksizedmenu if the food isnt good nnIf you want to talk supermarket sushi DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their ownand nobody knows  In fact its pretty good considering nnI also dont think the service is unfriendly at all  Maybe being busy and taskoriented not taking time to chitchat is mistaken for unfriendlinessI duno I just call it efficient nnTIP 2 You cant get their udon or ramen togonnBottom Line  If youre accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA or in cities with large Asian communities no this place isnt going to be on the same level but sometimes you dont need all the frills  Just a solid meal run by a family you can tell knows what theyre doingI used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic tastennWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrongnnThe lady wasnt so friendly but I dont mind she was like that all the time We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I dont remember a tempura udon and a chicken katsu nnI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making There was no delicacy I was surprised when he handed me the dish I obviously wasnt happy to see the result The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri or rice ballnnThen my chicken katsu and my moms udon came out The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting nothing more nor nothing less Rice chicken salad additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad and miso soup It was good Just normal chicken katsu Not so crispy this time The portion is pretty big My mom liked the udon The broth was clear and light color the tempuras came out on a separate plate Tempuras were just ok nnThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine I dont know if Ill comeback when Im in town again Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food But definitely no sushi at Musashi I just want to say that just because its owned by Japanese dont automatically assume that itll be goodThis is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending 2000 for airfare The food is awesome The people are awesome The place rocksnnTo all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressingthis is an authentic Japanese restaurant Not the American Hibachi down the street Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no boundsTACO BELLnnThe service is always perfect I love the staff there They let me practice my Japanese and are always excited when I get it right To the people saying the service is slow The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin Its JapanesennAgain hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small foodbar in the country This is NOT American style Japanese its AUTHENTICnnxe5x84xaaxe7xa7x80xe9xa3x9fxe5x93x81xefxbcx81Truly authentic Japanese food The staff is always friendly and welcoming Their ramen and udon are both very solid The bento boxes give you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious My personal favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai I have been known to order them for dessert while the wife prefers the green tea ice cream If you crave Japanese go check them out you will not be disappointedAuthentic and best ramen in Charlotte Dining area is small but the lunch specials are inexpensive and deliciousMy family has been loyally going here about 12 times a week for about 10 years The most authentic familystyle run Japanese restaurant youxc2xb4ll findIts been a few years since Ive come here but I know it has good sushi so I invited 5 friends  We tried the pork ramen and udon soups for the first time  They were ok but lacking the flavor I was expecting as if the broth was made some time ago and then the ingredients thrown in that day We all got softshell crab rolls and liked them  My Hornet Roll was very good and the tuna and yellowtail rolls were also very good  The staff is super nice and the quaint little paper room was great to have our group  We will be back for more sushiNice lunch specials one with warm items and one with sushinnSushi chef and waitresses speaking Japanese with customersnnFree wifi from neighboring businessesIve heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out Here are my reviewsnnVenue  the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan If you have a large group of people your group will be sitting as if youre sitting on a floor but your not The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open Its a comfortable sitting arrangementnnSushi  the Unagi Eel was cooked perfectly The softcrab shells are not bad but I had better ones before  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy They need better selections in sushinnPresentation  the restaurant lacks in presentation  It was a very simple dish put together  nnSake  they are pricey 1500 minimum nnRamen  the soup was very tasty  nnOverall  if you are craving for ramen this is the best place so far Ive tasted As for sushi I would only come here once Ive had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California Also if you dont tip enough You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip Its a MANDATORY  It feels like a teacher is about to scold youAfter failing at Mr Tokyo I chose another Japanese place I wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner Musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take  a min of 40min My parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box I ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that I couldnt order half the menu Never eating Japanese in Charlotte ever againUpfront disclosuresnI am a sushi snob and am extremely particular about my sushinnI am going to break my review into two parts  Typical Japanese food and sushi  nnTypical Japanese food We ordered some pork shumai that were pretty good but was served with a brownwasabitype paste  It tasted like wasabi but why the hell was it brown We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi  The kimchi was very spicy but good  The pork was a bit tough  nnThey have a whole list of special appetizers but only about 4 were translated into english  My girlfriend asked for more translation but the waiter told us we really wouldnt be interested in them so we dropped the conversation on it nnMy gut tells me this place has very good and very authentic Japanese food but I am not experienced enough in nonsushi Japanese food  nnOn to the sushi  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place  nnMusashi has a very small sushi menu  There are few rolls to choose from and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri  nnWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri  The fish was cut rather sloppily and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon  The salmon was all pink no typical whitefat lines  whynnThe rolls come in pieces of 3 which I find weird  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up as the rice was cold and solid  not like sushi rolled right in front of you nnWe have not been back  If youre looking for really really really authentic Japanese food I would head here and try  if youre looking for a great sushi experience I would try other places in the areaThis place was incredible Everything I tried I loved I highly recommend the pork ramen I could eat that everydayThe reason Im giving Musashi a 4star review is because I love their ramen noodles as well as their appetizers  They taste amazingnnHowever the sushi is down right awful  Its cold and tasteless kind of like supermarket sushi  After eating sushi at Musashi twice I gave up  So the only reason I go back is to have their amazing appetizers and ramen noodlesnnThe service is quite cold and unfriendly  I am not the type to want any chitchat between customer and server but the ladies there are quite cold unresponsive and slow  I prefer efficient service no chit chat no upselling  They tend to ignore you which is fine until you want to leave and they still ignore youJust an update still great food Prices have scooted up over the past couple of years Lunch box is 10 something now and Nabeyaki udon is 15Best sushi in town Apparently they are the most authentic japanese restaurant in Charlotte having hired one of the best sushi chefs Im not sure if thats true but the sushi is amazing If you go during lunch they have a special for 850 and is more than enough food to eat nnMy only complaint is that they dont have fountain sodas  so if you order youre getting a can But this doesnt stop me from giving this place 5 stars bc of the food is that goodSeriously this place is a diamond in the rough nnOkay so we were taken here when we visited before we moved by friends who lived in Japan for 30 years It is legit Japaneseowned familystyle restaurant and their food is both beautiful aesthetically and amazing tastes Can I say UMAMI Umm if you even slightly know anything about Japanese food go here You will not be disappointed Both their sushi and dishes are delicious nnYes it is true that the language can be a barrier if you try to edit things but there is a younger guy who works there that is helpful and speaks perfect english I personally am learning Japanese but I just go with the flownnOn the downside trying to call during hours in between openings ie 25pm is to no avail and so reservations highly recommended are harder to make ahead of time I would suggest calling when they are open towards the evening nnAnyway try itIf you are looking for the

sushi and hibachi places but theres always a little something that makes the restaurant a bit more of a Asian American fusion Musashi is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte because it is one of the most authentic restaurants both in the interior and the food and the servers are attentive I frequent this restaurant on a weeklybiweekly basis Delicious worth the drive from Huntersville  Best Sushi Ive had in a while The Shuman dumplings were perfect Very traditional Japanese   Red bean ice cream for desert pleasant surpriseGreat place Ive been in north Carolina for 3 years now and Ive

at the decor Our server was very attentive and helpful Absolutely no complaint about service herenn We have been here twice The first time we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer The gyoza were perfect  served with a chile oil and soy sauce The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms half an egg three pieces of pork that were very tender a piece of fish cake and noodles with a lovely chewy texture The broth tasted of every one of those things  a warm inviting flavor nnThe second visit I got the tonkatsu ramen again while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box Her box came with a whole tonkatsu 4pc California roll 2 shrimp tempora 4 pc vegetable tempora a seaweed salad miso soup a small salad a shrimp dumpling a pork dumpling and an egg roll Needless to say we had enough food for lunch the next day Those two meals plus sweetened tea for two came to almost 4200 For the atmosphere the friendly service and the authentic food I cant wait to go back and try the river eel over rice Please dont pass this one byAuthentic Japanese items on the menu that you dont see at other Japanese restaurants My favorites items have to be the ramen Its way better ramen than futobuta in South End We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and watching the sushi chef create beautiful dishes The place is really popular and event a wait at 630pm on a FridayIve been here twice Each time ive gotten ramen I must say theyre consistant The ramen is delicious and fresh nnService was great staff friendly Place is small expect to be seated near people you dont knownnI look forward to trying the sushi but until then I have nothing bad to sayWent for dinner  excellent tonkotsu ramen noodles  the broth was delicious Also has potato croquets  five stars Service was excellent as well This place is authentic the service is perfect  my favorite drink cones to the table before I ask they know all their customers nKeep up the great work nOh great sushi by the waySuper authentic casual Japanese restaurant  Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits but the more rarefied fish both grilled and rare are what attract me  nnThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar  They take some time to warm up but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes but I suppose thats unsurprisingnnMusashi is very casual and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus powdered wasabi and pink ginger   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish  Heres a rundown on what I hadnn Sashimi platter  I ordered a la cart a large sampling but you can do one piece each so everythings very small portion wise   As I saidauthenticn Anago  delicious butteryn ika  squid was a highlight very light and with a touch of crunchn surf clam  also delicious I was feeling their bivalves   They cater to the Japanese paletten tako  fresh and delicately flavorful  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  n ebi  slightly more flavorful than usualn saba  marinated and tastyn hamachi sake hirame maguro  fairly standard although the salmon was better than expectedn ikura  I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature  nnI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi however the selection and relative freshness were both very good  They didnt have any special fish such as toro  they said that specials come in during the weekends   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently  nn hamachi Kama  very fresh not previously frozen cooked with some interesting spices n mackerel  grilled and salted to perfection  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty juicy interior with a crisp skinn sanma  a little bit of a pain to eat since I dont do the guts however some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fishTried this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend  We had the vegetable tempura tonkotsu ramen and chicken katsu cutlet  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menunnProsnn The food here is authentic  I am not Japanese but this restaurants dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting OsakaTokyo  As far as I know this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soupsnIt seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise nService was good and food came out very quickly  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizernPrice is reasonable perhaps a touch highnnnConsnnnThe restaurant space is cramped  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangementfloorplannThe restrooms are single person restrooms  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky presumably from spilled fooddrinknThe portion sizes are not consistent  The tempura appetizernotably no onion rings was about 78 small vegetables which I consider to be small  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides  My ramen was just the right size  \n","2  We went there for dinner the other night being in Vegas for the weekend  We had driven by a couple of times and had it pointed out during the Haunted Vegas tour a couple years agonnPutting it simply the food was incredible  Being from NY I am an Italian food snob and this was some of the best I have ever had  I had the veal scallopini my wife had the chicken marsala and we were in heaven  Then we had the canolis for dessertnnThe service was fantastic as well  The place was pretty busy but service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was a lot of fun  This is definitely a place we will visit again next time we are in Vegasi had the best Chicken Marcela ever The spaghetti with meet sauce was nothing to rave about Prices are greatBasically the best Italian in town for the price  The service is USUALLY excellent  Food is consistently good  The atmosphere is Liberace cheesy but its part of the charmMmmmm delicious food and a little history Mr Liberace himself designed the interior of his restaurant and they have not changed it since his passing no this is not a bad thing The cheese manicotti in marinara sauce was absolutely delish just like home cooking should be The spumoni ice cream is home made by the way not store bought And if you happen to have a free moment you can breeze by the Liberace museum and check out his eye catching performance wearThis is old Vegas this atmosphere is old school but cool make sure to check out the Liberace bar too The food was good not great but really good food the lasagna was very tasty and the house dressing was very uniquen told the staff we had a show to get to in 45 mins and they got us in and out in plenty of time on a Saturday night nice worknits a must at least once given its historyHeavy on the atmosphere heavy on the red sauce light on the wallet  No the food here isnt great  But its good and I always make time to come here every time I come to Vegas  Its worth it just to see the piano bar  Recommendations chicken parm not veal for some reason meatballs gnocchi  Also they have a private dining room in which Ive had several successful events and make for a nice break from the typical trade show stuff  and definitely gets people to remember youThis place is fun I gave it an extra star because its next to the Liberace museum Any place located to close to Liberace MUST be fantastic right Right I guess In any case the food was just okay but the portions were pretty ginormous and the price was right The joint is off strip which was a nice change becuase its relatively peaceful there and the diners all seemed to be locals except us And trust we did stand out The ambiance is fun with differently themed and decorated rooms depending on your occasion and the bar there is dark as any other in Sin City but slightly divier Service was good albeit a little slow and all in all the meal was a success A little wine never hurt anyoneNOT CLOSEDnMoved to new addressnn9821 S Eastern AvenLas Vegas  NV 89183n7024315485nnExcellent food and serviceI like this place solely on its atmosphere  Its awesome  The food good but no frills  Its straight up  The portions are huge and service has always been greatThis is actually a 35 star review and Im giving Carluccios a bonus by rounding to 4 nnEmbarrassing that having lived in Vegas I had no idea Carluccios existed Some friends from Phoenix came down and wanted to meet at Carluccios for a group dinner When I arrived at the parking lot I was in awe This place was ostentatious and gorgeousjust the way I like it I felt like I was in on an old Vegas secret and someone was going to hand me a briefcase full of cash for me to do something illegal with Carluccios is right next to the Liberace museum something I need to go see and apparently Liberace designed the interior The interior was gold all over hanging lights dark lighting dark carpetsI loved it This is a great place to have a small dinnerfamily gathering nnNow for the foodservice Service was average My water glass was always full the waiter took our order fast and the service was pleasant Unfortunately the waiter we had made me nervous I asked if the Caesar salad was vegetarian and he said yes Then I confirmed if it had anchovies as many authentic Ceasars do and he said Oh yeahit does But he was quick to tell me the other dressings that would suit me The food also took forever to come out I ordered a mixed green salad with thousand island side salad and an eggplant parmigiana The mixed green came with about a gallon of thousand island on it rendering it inedible I like my dressing but I also like to see my salad Perhaps I should have ordered dressing on the side but I did not expect that much The eggplant parmigiana served with spaghetti with marinara was very good Fried to the right extent and with a gorgeous piece of melted mozzarella on top and drowned in tasty marinara this was comfort food that hit all the right stops nnEveryone else on the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals The portion sizes were huge I mean I could have eaten my parmigiana for about 4 meals No exaggeration here I later realized that they do have half orders for some of the menu So ask about that if youre a light eater The meal was also priced very very reasonably My parmigiana was 1299 and my husbands spaghetti with marinara was 899 nnThe dinner also came with a magician who entertained us for a little bit The guy was pretty good at what he did card tricks disappearing money that appears somewhere incredible later and added to a fun night nnHighly recommend this place for a unique group eventdinner Im definitely coming when my girlfriends make a trip here I know theyd appreciate the decor overthetop and dark Id like to mention here that some girls at the group ordered cocktails that were apparently awful The waiter did take the cocktails back Maybe you might want to stick to wine with your mealThis is my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas I am here a few times a year visiting family and whenever I am this is always on my list of places to go  The staff has always been friendly and the food has never disappointed me  The bread is really good tooI guess I need someone to tell me just what is good here foodwise perhaps next time I should check out the Yelp reviews first But the ambiance is totally awesome So it evens out to 3 starsnnI finally got around to eating here last weekend as part of my date night We hadnt read anything about it and thus had no idea what to expect As soon as we walked in we were in love This place perfectly represents that image of old Vegas I have in my head It was outlandish while also warm and welcoming I could just picture Liberace eating here I could also imagine the Rat Pack mobsters etc eating here as it just seemed so fitting of all of themnnWe started off our dining experience with the calamari Unfortunately it wasnt even edible We had little doubt that it came straight out of a box from the frozen food aisle 1 star For entrees I opted for the cavatelli it had an icon indicating it as one of their signature dishes and my husband had the gnocchi The menu described the cavatelli as sauteed and with meat sauce What I was served was neither sauteed nor meat sauce I almost asked if I was served the wrong thing but since our server was the wife of the owner I felt bad saying anything The pasta was too mushy the sauce wasnt very good at all and I barely tasted any cheese My date declared it inedible I nibbled at it a bit but refused a take home box 1 star My dates gnocchi was ok but also not cooked properly 2 stars And 1 star too for the wine listnnAt the end of our meal our server explained the history of the restaurant and gave us the lay of the land so to speak It was great to walk around and see all the different rooms love the bar area and all of the pictures especially the ghost pictures The place itself is most definitely 5 stars And that fact alone will bring us back here and have us recommending it to visitorsWe asked our hotel concierge for a restaurant recommendation  She said theres a place off the strip where you can get excellent cheap Italian food  She said Im Italian and I love it and all my out of town guests always ask to go there  So we said what the heck beats paying a fortune for a mediocre meal at one of the big fancy hotel restaurants  nnThe first note about Carluccios is it is right next door to the Liberace Museum  Las Vegas is such a bizarre place  Any way the interior is a flash back to to the 80s and still kind of charming in that bizarre Las Vegas sort of way  It was also dark inside which was a good thing because they would get negative stars for the cleanliness factor  Our bread basket and the inside of my menu had globs of marinara sauce on them  Tastyum nodisgustingnnThe bread was outstanding  It was just bread with no fancy dipping oil or vinegar Just good solid bread with butter  Side saladblech  Bottle of Pinot Grigioyummy friend pointed out it could be bought at Costco for half the price we paid  Mushroom appetizergood in conceptmushrooms in white wine sauce topped with cheese and baked  Not so good in execution as the wine sauce was tangy and harsh  Chicken parmigiana entree pretty tasty  It was served with a side of pasta with meat sauce containing very little meat to speak of  I tried my friends gnocchi and it was doughy tasting not in a good way  We skipped dessertnnService was poor but what do you expect when  you can get a bottle of wine 3 entrees 3 side salads and an appetizer for less than 80 the wine was half the bill at 40  nnThis place would be great for a group of people who want decent food for cheap  Plus Liberace is next door  Thats a big draw right there  Or notI have driven by  Carluccios many times over the past 20 yrs and always wanted to try it but never got around to it It always seemed to have an old school vibe which I like Picked up my uncle for an early dinner and he suggested  Carluccios he said it was very good Works for me Really cool decor very nice and attentive staff I had the ceasar salad which was cold and dressed perfectly I think the crutons may have been homemade Moved onto the meat stuffed ravioli which was great The portions are large as one expects at Italian and Mexican restaurants Had to take half home and eat the next day When you walk into the door the smell of garlic hits you which is a good sign I thought it was priced right 9 and up I will be backI didnt realize this place shutdown I used to love this place came here so many times when I lived in Vegas It was really good Italian food and pretty cheap compared to Sergios Italian Gardens a few doors down And I guess the whole Liberace museum is gone too the last of Liberace PlazaGreat prices romantic ambience delicious Italian basics  nnIf you are looking for a tasty meal but dont want to spend a fortune and its very easy to do that in Vegas Strip restaurants this is a great place just a few minutes East of the strip on Tropicana  nnIts very popular and a lot of locals eat there we saw cast members from one of the shows and the interior is whimsically designed by Liberace  mirrors strings of white lights dangling from everything Italian fountains  The recorded music features showtunes and jazz standards sung by greats such as Frank Sinatra Bobby Darin and even Rod Stewart but I believe they have live music as well maybe during happy hour  Its dark in the dining area but the thousands of string lights and candles on the table create a nice romantic glow  nnThe food was very yummy and very inexpensive for how good it was  I had the Cavatelli pasta a curved tubular pasta  a little like Penne with a break in it with Marinara and CLEANED my plate  My husband had spaghetti with meat sauce and mushrooms and he liked his a lot as well  We shared fried calamari with marinara  The pasta dishes were 9 each and my husband took most of his home  nnWe love Italian food and for the price this is one of the best in Vegas  We barely spent 30 for the both of us which is great because we went to an Italian restaurant in a hotel restaurant on the Strip and spent 50 per person  I wish we had gone to Carluccios for Valentines Day because the ambience is romantic yet fun  It is nothing fancy but they do basics very well  I would like to go back to try their fish dishes other entrees are priced between 12 and 20  nnLike Italian food  Then you MUST try CarlucciosWe had a 50 anniverasy here for my grandparents They accomdated us very well We had a private room with all our close family and friends We were able to drop the  cake off early and they stored it for us Wine was on the tables and food was delish We had a couple options to choose from It was perfect for my grandparents as they are fans when coming to Las Vegas from californiaIts my familys favorite place  They have been taking me there for years  Its a pretty simple joint  Not a big wine list  Not pretentious  Really fantastic red sauce  I eat the Shrimp Fra Diavolo with the hot marinara  The veal dishes are really good and what you would expect Italian to be  Other places get fancy Carluccios gets it right  Best of all they have been around for as long as Ive been around  Nothing has changed  Every taste is like it was many many years agoI LOVE THIS PLACE  The first time we ate there it was 21 years agoI  go there for the chicken livers with a tarragon cream sauce served over a bed of linguine  YUMMMY  Hosted a dinner party two years in a row for 40 people and the bill was reasonable Fun place to gonot fancy datedbut the food is good  The lasagne was yummy tooand hrmmm what else did I steal off someones platestuffed mushroomsand hrmm scampi  LIFE IS GOODCant say much more than what everyone else has already said  as far as old school Vegas Italian food places go this is my favorite spot in town  How can you go wrong with good solid food and a Liberace designed interior nnCalories be damned this time I went for the Shrimp Alfredo  which was absolutely stellar  Wide ribbon noodles in a decadent thick alfredo sauce that was seriously one of the best Ive ever had  The portions are HUGE  so I have leftovers for lunch today  My husband had the Shrimp Oreganado which looked fabulous with a side of spaghetti  he liked it so much he polished it off  He may as well have licked the plate nnIf you go  dont forget to take a peek in the piano lounge supposedly the most haunted room in Vegas according to the magician performing there   A charming room with twinkle lights in the ceiling a pianoshaped bar classic white Eero Saarinen Tulip chairs and a fabulous mirrored piano a la Liberace  Thursday happy hour has live music too  Prices are reasonable  our party of four got out for half of what we paid a month ago at Casa Di Amore down the streetnnCant wait to go back  as Liberaces theme song would sayIll Be Seeing YoudefinitelyWhen I heard the Liberace Museum was shutting down was wondering if theyd still be open  Im happy to report they are  And they remain one of my favorite places in Vegas and a tribute to red sauce  The chicken parm was as good as ever and the service was excellent  And you cant beat the interior design  I love this placeThis is a wonderful hidden treasure  Ive driven by there a thousand times and even went to the Liberace museum when it was still open  However I didnt think to try the restaurant until my mom bought a dining deal  I went with my parents and had this old school throw back Italian meal  My mom had the lasagna a la carte  Huge piece came out  I doubt you could eat much more than that portion  She took half of it to go  My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish I cant remember the name of it  I tried a couple bites and it was very good  I had this shrimp and garlic dish cant remember the specific name of it either but it was very good  In fact I took a piece of bread and mopped up the rest of the sauce  Every meal comes with a side of spaghetti and marinara  I was too full to eat it but my dad said it was very good  nnA couple weeks later my husband and I went for their Thursday night happy hour  Its so wonderful to go into the bar area  If you like anything that sparkles youll love this place  The bar is a white piano and sparkles from the ceiling to the floor  They also have live music on Thursday nights  Not sure if they have different acts but the night we were there the people were very talentednnMinimum my husband and I will be back for their happy hour  Im sure well make it for dinner tooComfortable  quiet  I feel nurtured in this joint  I eat in the bar so I can feel close to the piano weird I know  I dont go for the food but it is enjoyable  The chicken marsala has an eclectic sweet taste which is refreshingnnPS  Dont call old Vegas tacky its Fabulous Las Vegas not 7 shades of Beige Las VegasnRIP LiberaceThe Olive Garden by any other name is still The Olive GardennnGo to Noras on Flamingosimilar prices radically better wine list and many many times better overallIve been always wanting to try Carluccios  Im an often Vegas tourist who likes to explore nookandcranny museums eateries et al I know life is more than the Strip  I have the opportunity to finally get there over July 4th weekend  All you need to know is that I did so in 111 degrees and via bus  and it was oh so well worth itnnFirst the service and staff were wonderful  Id been seated maybe 5 minutes and looking at the menu when another server or manager insisted on making sure I got some water because I looked like Id been out in the sun  For an older restaurant the service was anything but attitudewise  very enthusiastic friendly knowledgeablevery homeynnFoodwise wow for the choices and taste and also for the reasonable prices  I had the stuffed shrimp which came witha side of pasta I wanted to try the sauce plus I ordered a side of meatballs along with a  casesars salad  For dessert I had to try  or shall I say ingest  a homemade cannoli   All food items were exceptionally tasteful authentic unique flavorfuland the homemade bread was yummy as well  Plus I did check out the lounge area for all the celb pics and piano bar and all the historical things thanks to other reviewers for suggestingnnJust an allaround great dinning experience after a scorching hot day of playing tourist  Totally hit the spotnnPS  As i understand it the Trop location is closing Liberace closing wasnt good with the restaurant tucked back in the shopping center and a smaller version will be opening in Henderson  If I get to Henderson ona future trip you can be sure I will be there for dinnerBe forewarned they are very heavy in their sauces and you can order light sauce This would have been helpful to us if we had known before hand nnWith that being said this place was a disappointment  Its Italian food with upscale pricing but low scale food quality Ive never been to an Italian restaurant where they serve prepackaged butter with their bread sticks The food was covered in their sauce and it looks like you received a bowl of sauce They do serve a lot of food and we were like every table there taking food home in a container nnThe ambiance was very dark and loud Dress ranged from formal to tshirt casual The staff was very friendly though nnIn the end I dont think Id make another visit here on my next Vegas tripSometimes when I go to an older place like this I have to decide if it is a run down dump or if it authentic and charming  Carluccios has the old school charmnnThe place is by the now derelict Liberace Museum on east Tropicana  I am guessing it has been here for 2030 years which is a long time by Vegas standards so it has some history  The place has brick walls old school burgandy colored booths custom wood door dark wood in the bar area and I loved the black and red tiles in the bathroom  nnIt has a bar area restaurant area and we sat in the atrium area at a table  The hostess and waitress were very friendly  nnThe menu was typical of a Italian joint  The prices seemed reasonable  I ordered the meatballs and sausage plate  It was a large offering with a side of pasta  Very tasty  the meat sauce was right on  I tried a friends chicken parm  that was tasty  Huge servings at reasonable prices  nnCarlucios is so not corporate and thats why I really like itOMG I cant say enough about this place Was in town heard about this place so we decided to try it out We heard about if from the man who does the Vegas ghost tours There was nine of us and we ALL LOVED the place We LOVED it soooo much we went back the next night   John the owner was so nice he told of all about the ghost stories John and his staff are so nice They have a magican that comes around the table He was really good  sorry cant remember your name   The food was so good and they give you so much The pasta primavera was the best I ever had The bartender is the best I will be back everytime I go to Vegas If i could give it more stars I would John  your crew and you are FANTASTIC keep up the good workBest service I have had in a long time  He cared and made sure everyone was having a good time and meant itFood was excellent for the price 912 for all meals and the place is all lit upYou need to go here if you want to get off the stripIt is a good experience inside as well as outside with the neon pianoA late sixties year old woman struggled to light a cigarette sitting on a bench below the Carluccios Tivoli Gardens neon sign high above her  I hate having to come out side to smoke she mumbled pulling her light sweater over her shoulders   Our party bus pulled into the parking lot and drove past the Liberace Museum and neon grand piano and stopped in front of the smoking Carluccios regular  We all streamed out of the bus as she reviewed and evaluated each one of us I bet most of these kids dont even know who Liberace was she mused  I opened the wood carved door to the Liberace design restaurant and the team entered into a world hip and cool 35 years ago that is now hip and cheeky in 2007nnI travel to Las Vegas at least two times a year for various trade shows for eBay or for various social events  Like many of my friends I get tired of the big casino hotspots that we all read about in the hotel room Las Vegas magazines   Thankfully my friend Jennifer found Carluccios through her parents that live in the area and decided to host our team party there  Carluccios was probably THE place to be for Las Vegas hip in the 70s and is now a refreshing escape for those of us looking for something differentyet sill Las VegasnnApparently Carluccios was designed by Liberace and it shows Each room is a different style from a dark lounge with vinyl booths to an Italian sculpture garden to the allmirrored back room replete with a bar shaped like a piano and twinkling lights on the ceiling  Our group from eBay found our way to the mirrored back room where we enjoyed hearty Italian food Bottles of Chianti housed in the traditional whicker baskets greeted us and were free flowing accompanied by mozzarella and tomato and fried calamari hors doeuvres  Due to our group 21 size Carluccis served a fixed menu including veal parmesan chicken picatta and Lasagna  The food was great for the basic Italian fare and the portions are HUGE  Most of the group only ate half of what was served  Id recommend even ordering one entre and splitting it I had the veal which was a little tough and smothered in sauce and cheese  That should tell connoisseurs of Italian food that its not topline quality  However  Henry had the chicken parmesan which he said was good and Beth had the lasagna which she seemed to enjoynnWe were entertained by a great piano bar duet Gus and Kathy  Gus is a stage name for CJ who is a full time plumber in Las Vegas  Kathy is a long time friend of 30 years who sings with Gus in his OffThe Strip appearances Gus with is long gray pony tail and grey bushy mustache tickled out basic Sinatra tunes and 70s hits like Easy Like Sunday Morning Kathy chimedin with dowaps and chorus versus when appropriate  My friend Beth requested for me Staying Alive by the Bee Gees hoping to elicit a performance reminiscent of Marty and Elaine from Swingers  However Gus did not have that song on his laptop that sat on top of his piano serving as his sheet music Beth was able to get More Than A Woman played for those of us with a Barry Gibb cravingnnAfter Gus and Kathys final number we cleared out of the back room shaking hands with the musical duo and thanking Carluccis manager for a great experience  Overall the food was goodnot great  However the AMBIANCE and the oldschool Las Vegas experience is OFF THE CHARTS  I HIGHLY recommend taking the 10 cab ride off the strip to experience this restaurant  I get the feeling most frequent Vegas travelers are not aware of this hidden vinyl and polyester gemThis was one of the most wonderful places to go tonEspecially for birthdaysnEverything tasted like wine the food was beyond greatnThe stuffed mushrooms ruled the earthnThe seafood diablo was the shitnThe chocolate mouse tasted like a shot of boozennI loved the atmosphere and the classiness The twinkly white lights it was so Liberace chic nEvery room was beautiful and so was the bar This was one of the last great las Vegas gems to fade outnnEvery time I drive by I get sadnI was 16 when i had my nice birthday dinner there nI wish this place would just come backCarluccios is the king of Italian restaurants in Vegas For the price for quality and quantity it doesnt get any better Service is great and the location is right off the strip All you new comers and old timers in town need to make this your Italian go toThis is my favorite Italian place in Vegas It has great local history being that as Tivoli Garden it was owned by the one and only Liberace It has one of his pianos in the back seating area and the back bar is grand piano shaped The food is really really good and the atmosphere hearkens back to the good old days of Vegas when the Rat Pack and the Mob were headliners I have gone here for the 13 years I have lived her and consider it a must show to visitors who think the Strip is Vegas We know betterTHIS is Vegas BABYIf you want great Italian food that will not break the bank This is the place to go This place has been there since the early 1980s and you can tell by the decor They have their fair share of loyal customers including myself nnThe food there is awesome The seafood diablo is a must have so is the orange roughy in white sauce If you like shrimp the crab stuffed shrimp is great as an appetizer or as an entree The zuppa the clams is also a great appetizer nnI know service is a hit or miss This is the same with all restaurants However I still give it 5 stars for great food that is not over priced No one can beat this placeThis restaurant just moved to Silverado Ranch Blvd  and Eastern Avenue The address is 9821 South Eastern Ave Why would I tell you that because without a doubt this is my favorite Italian Restaurant The sauces are all authentic and old school Italian nI have tried so many items lasagna raviolis cheese and meat Zuppa de Clamson and on I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered The homemade bread is amazing My husband loves the chicken parmigiana and it is the most tender chicken I have ever tasted You can tell they tenderize it properly in the kitchennThis restaurant has an incredible staff everyone is wonderful The food the staff make it worth the drive nSo look for the Doc Hollidays behind Freeds Bakery and you will find the new location for the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas  I just wish I could get the recipe for the sauceabsolutely perfect nThe desserts are excellent too If I have an opportunity to go out to dinner this is where I go See you thereIve been to Carluccios several times the last being on January 24 2011  Unlike prior experiences I was less than satisfied  The Casaer Salads were watery and when complained and asked that they be replaced we got more of the same  I had Spaghetti  meatballs as my entree  The meatballs and sauce were bland and there was probably a quarter of a cup of pasta water in my plate  I didnt bother complaining  I think they lost a customerBeing a 2nd generation Sicilian and growing up eating true homade italian cuisine you can expect me to be extremely picky when it comes to italian food  One of the great things I love about vegas is if good dego eats is what you crave chances are youve got a top notch joint with in 5 minutes away from you at any given time and carluccios is one of the best  For an old school vegas feel great service and phenominal food look no further  Whenever I go I get linguini with muscles clams shrimp and calamari  I cant tell you the exact name of the dish but it comes in red spicy arabiata style sauce and it is to die for  nnWith its central location just minutes from the strip this place is perfect for locals and tourist a like  If your visiting do yourself a favor forget about the overpriced strip hotel restraunts And pay carluccios a visit you wont be disapointedGreat ambiance  Real old school Vegas feel to it  Food was good but not great  The chicken marsala had a different taste to the sauce  A bit of a mapley flavor to it  Portions are not very big  Still its a decent place to eat for Italian and I will be backalright soheres the deal if youre looking for something a bit different experience wise thats not super vegas strip typical fare this is definitely the place to visit the experience a visual buffet the food averagennthe food is moderately good ive had way worse but its not amazing the red sauce is somewhat bland and slightly tangy which is definitely not my stylennthe portion size was huge we had the veal florentine and chicken parmesan the veal was so super tender and moist the chicken was alright nnwas it worth it just for the strange Liberace ambiance and casual no frills attitude absolutely it looks like this was the place where all the mobsters would eat flashing bulbs on the ceilings and brown brick walls with yellow windows everyone in the place was having a great time laughing it up getting loud and boisterous which is a good signnni admit it the next morning i wished i hadnt wasted a vegas meal on this place but ill surely never forget it i think the lights have been burned into my memory foreverService kinda sucked so did the food Its a meal though and if someone else is paying why complain I wouldnt go there again thoughI cant enough about this place as where to go to show out of town guests a piece of classic Las Vegas nnAnyplace named I Lov it spelled backward by Liberace is worth a try especially if you remember his shows nnWe went as a group and sat in the piano bar room The owner was happy to show us all of the great Liberace memorabilia and where when the place was owned by Liberace he liked to sit nnOur food was fantastic I had the chicken livers tarragon This was the recommendation of our server for something unique from their menu It was fantastic tremendously filling with lots of garlic butter good wine and perfectly prepared tender livers If you are a fan of liver I know it is not everyones favorite this is the meal for you nnKelly our bartender knows all of the classic cocktails and talked us into trying an Italian margarita She also can make the champagne drinks Liberace loved so much This is a great place for a good classic cocktail nnThe restaurant is not your typical pub for Las Vegas No video poker machines no blaring televisions you go here and talk to the rest of your party Compared to the strip food the portions are generous and reasonably priced nnFamilies are welcome and seated in a separate section of the restaurant for a traditional family dinner Then we saw some secret booths at the front which reminded us of downlow mob meeting places where nobody is going to see you spill the goods to the feds nnAn evening at Carluccios makes me rejoice in that for once Las Vegas has embraced its history and the owners of this place have decided to keep kitsch alive

Located in the Neonopolis Mall on the ground level Lots of old school pinball machines and video games Machines are all clean and well maintained Very friendly staff Despite being on Fremont St they do not have tourist prices Well bright well lit overall safe and fun environmentCame on a Sunday afternoon and there were a few other groups but it wasnt too crowded nnGreat games including all of the usual suspects and some newer stuff nReally good prize selection with reasonable redemption value Place was clean and well maintained and the two staff members were helpful and friendlynnLove that they still have tokens and physical tickets along with self serve ticket counter machines so you get the satisfaction of watching the machine dispense tickets but dont have to carry them around until the endMy husband  I stumbled upon this place People working are nice games are pretty fun The price for every game just a bit muchThis place is amazing  Jesses customer service is even better  Pac man  Time Crisis skee ball  pin balls machines  everything  And they ALL work  nA must go when Im downtown Vegas Old school vibe in a clean atmosphere with amazing serviceHad some time to kill before bar hopping on East Fremont so I walked over to give this place a shot It reminds me of the mall arcade I used to go to as a child Not a huge number of games to choose from but there is a variety in types of games pinball racing skee ball pop a shot air hockey shooters claw machines etcnnIt only gets three stars because it lacks in comparison to other arcades in Vegas Places like Dave  Busters and GameWorks blow this place away on size and variety Hotel arcades on the Strip are better options too eg Midway at Circus Circus and Big Apple Arcade at New York New York If youre a pinball fan the Pinball Hall of Fame has exponentially more machines and are cheaper to playnnI wouldnt go out of my way to visit again but ultimately its not bad It served its purpose when I had to kill 30 minutes Nothing more nothing lessNice and clean with fun games Pay the cashier directly to get extra ticketsdont use the machine Ok prizes and overall funI dont know how I just found out about this place but thankfully found it by mistake while wandering downtown with friends So this area is tucked away a lil near the mega dennys It is a tad small on the inside and most of the really cool games are 4 tokens a piece but enough boo hooing My friend and I had a blast at this place He was all about the mega space invaders game which was very fun but once I saw mario kart in an arcade my nostalgia ADD brain went into seek  destroy mode I believe you can have up to four racers at a time My friend picks the hardest track while he boasts his mario kart skills the race starts the 3rd player was left in the dust meanwhile him and I are neck and neck in the final lap and he is just about to cross the finish line when BOOM turtle shell obliterates him while i win the race D its just like the good ole days of playing either super or mario kart 64 with your friends Another fun game there was a new Crusin game which was great We didnt get a chance to explore the whole arcade or play some air hockey  but leaves us something to look forward to upon our next visit All in all this was a really neat area tucked away in fremont To the folks bitching about being tricked into spending alot of money for a crappy prize uh you ever been to chuck E Cheese P thats the way the tickets crumble I highly suggest checking out this place if you are in the area GAME ONI am so blessed I stumbled upon this place while I was out for the night I dont know how I didnt know about it since I live 5 minutes walking away Tucked away is probably whynnPlace is really simple and cool Come play some air hockey driving games skeeball or pinball For a small space they have some good games to play Some for prizes tickets or just funnnMy friends had a blast playing air hockey and pinball for an hour Place doesnt charge to go in and not over priced at all 1 is four token Most games take two tokens so a dollar goes far there nnDefiantly coming back for sure any day Im down there or just bored at home If you are on Fremont look this place up for some fun while you are visiting or living here If your have kids this is a great escape for you both Most adults Im sure could find something they like I know I didGreat employees great game choice Id highly recommend it to all the under 21 ers Actually Id highly recommend for anyone who likes games My husband and I took our 3 teenagers and we ha a couple hours of fun in air conditioning Very clean which is a huge plus as well  Go check it out its at the end of Fremont St past DennysGreat games Staff is always friendly and its always a fun time stopping in herenI do miss the pinball but such as lifeCame here over the weekend visiting from out of town  Awesome spot off Fremont St  Very nostalgic with cool games that remind me when I was a kid  they have a lot of new games that were a lot of fun too  Staff was greatIll definitely be back soonCheck grouponcom for at least a 50 coupon to get you started  I grabbed 10 in tokens for 5   That will get me warmed up   There are other deals for tokens upon arrival   Read the signs or ask the employeennI was there to play the pinball machines  Most machines were LEs limited addition models and in pristine condition   Some had tasteful modifications that added to the games play or aesthetics nnI also liked how youre allowed to bring in drinks from the outside   Water soda and of course beer and other alcohol   Not sure about foodnnAlso a big plus was the location its back in a nook   Off the main path of Freemont street where it can get a little weird and sometimes unsafe     The staff was nice and helpfulnnEnjoy    I will be back and back and back   This is a great alternative to the Pinball Hall of FameLow stars for the stupid way they trick you into coming in and spending money nnMy husband once ran an arcade and we both love that they are coming back but dont deceive people into thinking that they won something then force them to spend money to see what it is We probably only spent 10 and had a good enough time everything was in working order because the place is new I believe The have a bathroom which is a huge plus to me We liked the pinball games and the retro games like pacman nOur price was a 10 cent sucker Ironic I wonder what the teenage boy that won the big prize actually got20 was a long time of a ton of fun Get started upstairs with a couple of drinks and you cant go wrong Will definitely be backThis place rocks for its size Love the pinball machines Have a blast every time I go A place I take all my friends when they come into town And lets face it Id rather support small business in Vegas than the big places like Dave that dont give back to the communityOkay so its ALL ABOUT THE MARIO CART RACING I have never seen this game before in an arcade and it is so much fun The driving synchronizes nicely with what is expected It doesnt have delay or turn too hard or too little It feels responsive and what you would want from a turn Using the power ups is also a lot of fun because its partially skill based You have to aim most shells and other power ups which for me makes it a lot more fun I went back a couple times just for this and head to head racing with my SO lolnnAside from the mario kart game you can find the standard games youd expect in an arcade at fair prices and the staff is friendly Would recommend visitingGreat selection of pinball with well maintained games and a helpful attendant Best fun I have had in Vegas for 5Fremont Arcade is tucked behind Dennys on East Fremont on the first floor of Neonopolis Its a smallish arcade frequented by adults more so than by children My younger siblings and dad having frequented larger arcades in Vegas still had a lot of fun here My kid brother loved the basketball games and the old man gravitated towards a huge Galaga game This was hands down the most popular game in the arcade At some points people were queuing up to play this old classic Theres also a an old school Galaga game that only costs 2 tokens to play My dad played for like 15 minutes and got the second highest scorennThe drawback to this arcade is that its quite expensive Most games costs 4 tokens 1 to play We easily burned through our game play over the course of 30 minutes Even the pinball machines cost 4 tokens to play I seen that prizes are available but I didnt see any tickets being dispensed from the games so I dont know how prizes work here Still the Fremont Arcade is worth a visit especially if you have kids in townnYELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017 16Made it  down there today  what fun experience Arcade was very clean a lot of games and the biggest Pac Man game Jesse was very helpful explaining the games Will return Wishing him much successIts cool Nothing special Largest PAC man game is dope Pretty expensive The old arced feeling is non existentThe Fremont Arcade is located directly off the Fremont St Experience in downtown Las Vegas I stopped in a few times during a recent trip to Las Vegas and had a great time They have a wonderful selection of games prizes worlds largest PacMan pinball and my favorite air hockey I went with my youngest sister and her husband and we had a BLAST We played a bunch of games and I laughed loudly during an exciting game of airhockey nnThe owner Jesse was there and he was very helpful and friendly He helped us when we couldnt figure out how to use the coin machine and showed us some games he thought we might like nnI would definitely recommend Fremont Arcade Its a great spotWaste of money lol I went in and spent 20 on coins for my BF and I only to find that they had a 25 package that includes 100 coins PLUS a medium sized plushy I top of that you dont even actually play to win a prizetickets Youre way better off going to Circus CircusThey got a really nice line up of pinball machines and arcade machines  All quality  If youre a pin fan and like Stern games this place is with a visitKids had fun All the games are 1 so you cant have too much fun without going broke lol All the machines were up and working Its smaller than what the pictures make it seem so I wouldnt come with too many ppl or you might end up waiting for others to get off a game Other than that next time Im on Freemont I may stop in and play a game or twoAnybody good at air hockey herenCant find a good opposer nDM mennGreat place to have fun BTW nDo not hesitate to try everythingI visited the Fremont Arcade today on a field trip with some students and they loved it This place is truly a hidden treasure  The arcade is super clean and there are tons of games for every age The addition of the ticketed games definitely was a hit with the kids Connor was super accommodating and ensured that we all had a great time If you are looking for a fun kidfriendly experience in Downtown Las Vegas look no further the Fremont Arcade is awesomeSUPERCHECKS HOCKEY need I say more  This place is great Tons of pinball too The place is clean and the staff is awesome You need to check it outIm always glad to see new businesses opening up in the downtown area I was especially excited to see a new arcade and in the old Neonopolis building I was devastated when Jillians closed as that was a regular spot for me when I was a teenagernnThis arcade has a lot of cool games and they have pinball which I love I was glued to the pinball machines on my last visit Its pretty spacious too at least for now Only gripe I have is that all the games are 4 tokens 1 each Hope they do some price adjusting but Ill definitely be back to try some more gamesThis is the place to go if you want arcade babay lol no malfunctiones no broken machines and no bs greatest host ever Jesse you are the best manThis place has the largest pac man game  Its a bit hard to get to but its a fun place if you have kids  There are no restroomsThis will be their 21st review and I couldnt be more happy to give it I know the general Yelp rule is to be skeptical of a 5 star average business with so few reviews but this place deserves it nnSmall but mighty Fremont Arcade is clean and air conditioned to the perfect temperature There is an employee on sight who greets you as you walk in and sits in the center console to answer any questions you may have hand out prizes and offer support if something is malfunctioning There arent any classic games in here other than a neat row of pinball machines Most games are newer or at least newer versions of older games They have a lot of shooting games you can play with a buddy including the Walking Dead and Transformers Transformers is ridiculous but fun It was probably my fave nnPrices are decent for what you get It IS Vegas The Pinball price was a tad much but the pinball machines are all in excellent condition Hobbit Pinball was a blast If someone is playing it you have to watch Theres basically a movie going on at the same time The Star Wars Battle Pod is SICK OMG I could play that thing ALL DAY nnThis might be the only arcade Ive ever been to where everything is pristine and in good working order No token eating to be found here There was one game that needed some jimmying but that was it The Fast  the Furious game even gave me a random free play for my crowning achievementof getting 5th place in a race What a treatnnI should have asked the Lone Gamer employee if this place just opened or something because it really was the perfect experience If a huge amount of people came running in here it probably wouldnt be as fun The space itself is not big That was the only potential hiccup I saw in design as Fremont Street can get slammed on weekend evenings nnYet another of my growing list of reasons why I prefer Fremont Street to the Strip Way to go Fremont Arcade You were an oasis for two nerds killing time between brekkie and Las RageousnnTip Yes theres a bathroom Yes theres a change machineGreat off the beaten path place to stop in while in Vegas and take a bit of a break from The Fremont Experience Lots of pinball selection was a little disappointed to be honest with the lack of old school stand up arcade games Ms Pacman Galaga Donkey Kong ect All in all ALOT of funCame on a Wednesday morning Conner helped us out he was super friendly Had alot of great token deals for the kids Spent about 5 hours here flew by but walked out with a game system console pool game and unicorn earsSome of the best maintained pinball machines youll find anywhere Has a good mix of games too including new Hobbit oneFremont Arcade is an awesome arcade right in the heart of Fremont Its a great break from all the hustle and bustle of Vegas All the games are new and work great The coin machine even takes a creditdebit card The owners are so nice too Do yourself a favor and pop on in hereThis place kicks ass Great games

 \n","4  Its awesome hereThe guys are soooo hot and niceThe host London is amazing at the mic and getting the crowd excitedhighly recommend this placeI came to Hunk Mansion April 11th 2014 for my 40th Birthday not knowing what to expect I was down for anything at that moment Thomas was so pleasant and helpful as we were greeted and given front side stage seating VIP TREATMENT The men were respectful and very tasteful giving all the ladies attention as if they were the only one in the room I was given two stage performances one by Ready and boy was he READY so was I lol the other gentleman Speedy I guess was funny as hell I recommend this place if you wanna have fun that never endsladies bring your wallet things can add up Is it worth it  Hell yea Beware of Dave the MEANIE hes a driver for the mansion he will pick you up  and drop you off back to your hotel if the PRICE is right Otherwise your stuck at the mansion he will politely text you and say you didnt tip so no ride home plus Im off I simply laughed  Im from Oakland BABY I can get down lol staff handle the situation well providing drinks to me and my girls as they hooked up a ride for us Would I return yes  Thanks for a wonderful night fellas I do apologize for this late review                                                            nnnn                                                                                        TameikiaI planned a bachelorette party for my friend and there were 6 of us At first  we chose the 25 pp package with limo pickup admission and 2 drinks until I read in fine print does not include limo ride back to hotel So then we went with the package of 45 pp to include limo pickup and drop off VIP entrance reserved seating and 2 drinks All along they tell you please do not be late for limo pickup so I made sure we were on time however the limo was about 40 min late and not only that they show up in a shuttle bus Not cool And there was another group of girls with us which was ok but not what we paid for The driver did apologize and said there would be a limo to take us back Then we pull up to Hustler club No where in the info I looked up said it was at the hustler Again no big deal but wouldve been nice to know thats where it was at No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early Seated limited Ok so the male strippers were good with the girls and bride to be however their bodies were all so stubly or prickly as though the hadnt been freshly waXed or shaved A big turn off Never the less we had a good time I just wish it was a little more organized Ands since we paid that much money and then had to pay another 60 to get bride onstage was a little muchI came here for my 40th First of they offer free limo service to and from which was really cool  When we first arrived we were greeted by the manager he walked us up to the top floor where the male review was and told us we had the choice of seats wherever we wanted  We were also given two drink coupons per person so we ordered a drink and got seated The show started off slowly but what I really liked is the guys came out to sit and talk to you also they were really cool about taking pictures By the end of the night it was so crowded but it was amazing had the best time I definitely will be back I hope soonI love this Place  Every time Im in Vegas I stop by and have some fun at this place  I go to see Convict and the Cowboy  Great placeThis place is great And our waitress Jakki was awesome Forget Chippendales etc  This is the place to goLooks nice on the outside and on the pics but I was really disappointed  I met by best friend in Vegas for a girls weekend The limo for Hunk Mansion was scheduled to pic us up and never showedafter multiple phone calls and confusion between drivers as to who was coming to pick ua b up and then one getting into an acciddentit ended up being to close to closing to even goso we booked to go the second night They actually did pick us up in what was supposed to be a party bus for two of us I guess but looked like an airport shuttle with hunk mansion Written on the side  nWe got to the club and I was getting hopefulu was nucemusic was goodand we were told where to go for the men and immediately lost hope No one greeted usit was smallpretty emptyno energywe picked a tablethe guys were pretty hot but there were only 4 We sat waiting for a server and realized you go to the bar and get your own drinkswhich I did and they were pretty bad Finally one dancer came over to talk to ushe was very hotexplained how things workedthought things were going to get betterthen all the dancers disappeared for a stage show for the  Bachelorette dancewhich was pretty badwe calledOGS and leftdidnt even finish our crappy drinks All the bells but no whistlesvery disappointedMagic Mike eat your heart out These boys can dance  Take your bachelorettes here ladies Theyll hate you for a minute but love you for the rest of their livesMy friend and I made reservations online for 30 each which would get us a limo pick up admission and two drinks We were told to be downstairs at a certain area at 915 Our limo driver John was 1015 minutes late and then he couldnt find us I kept telling him where we were and he told us to go an opposite way All he had to tell us was that he was across the street from us Instead we walked down the street the wrong way and he flipped a uturn to get us When we got to the club with the other girls in the limo they told us he was already in a bad mood before he got us When we go to pay the cashier told my friend and I 40 each I argued saying we reserved for 30 but she said our ticket says 40 She told us wed get a ride back so we obliged The moment we sit down at a table 5 different guys were on us asking if we wanted a dance My friend pointed at me and I guess he whispered to her it was 25 We said nevermind We had JUST sat down and wanted to warm up and get the feel of the place these guys were pushy All of us at the table agreed we were thinking thered be a stage show and then mingling time Instead there was a few short stage shows and the guys were doing lap dances at the same time as the show Youd think theyd give eachother enough respect to not do lap dances during the show since the guy on stage could make more money if everyone was paying attention to him We spent a few hours here and we were told to call our limo driver for the return ride I called and texted him Waited 45 minutes without a response When I asked one of the girls at the main entrance downstairs for help she said there was nothing they could do since it was another company in a mean tone and practically rolling her eyes This makes me think it happens more times then not We ubered out of there instead This experience was supposed to be fun and exciting but instead it felt like a rip off and the customer service was AWFUL and NONEXISTENT Only help I had was from Thomas who offered us another night with some shots but honestly we never want to go back I asked for the difference we were forced to pay without getting a ride back and I got that within a few daysHonestly I have never posted a review on yelp and Im pretty wary of bad reviews  But I encourage you to never visit hunk mansion I did a lot of research for this place and every promise was broken  I got the set of tickets that includes a reserved table but once we got there pretty much all the tables were taken and we had a party of 5 which is hard to accommodate When we got there we asked where we would sit and the lady at the front said that we could sit anywhere I specifically asked if we could sit at tables with reserved signs and she said yes But we sat at a table with a reserved sign and the manager said wed have to buy a 350 bottle to sit there We went to the first lady to say she told us it was ok to sit there and she ended up saying we had to speak to the manager He ended up telling us we could have the seats and a bottle for a generous discount of 150 We declined and he said he was overbooked and there was nothing he could do about it We obviously argued that we paid for the reserved table and he would not budge We ended up waiting and finding a table Then even though we were upset and tried to make the best of it we were told as part of our ticket price wed get 2 free drinks When we tried to get our second drink we were told that we couldnt redeem our drink tickets after an hour even though literally no one said that and the website didnt say it either Honestly it was my birthday and I wanted to have fun but it pretty much ruined my experience NEVER come to hunk mansion They just lied and treat you like crap when you try to get what was promised to youSuch an amazing place We came here with a group of 11 girls for my friends 30th and it was everything we could of hoped for and more Such a fun experience the guys were very nice and very very built Loved watching the guys and their routines I cant say enough good things about Hunk Mansion We seriously had the best time and I will for sure be coming backPerfect place for a bachelorette party Everyone had a great time Excellent service from the VIP host bartender and cocktail waitress Jakki The dancers are amazingSo much fun It was my friends birthday Shed not been with a man in quite some time and she was a selfdescribed prude I needed an environment where she could cut loose and have fun but feel safe and comfortable Id spoken with the manager ahead of time and hed been exceptionally honest in saying that he couldnt promise me the best seats etc He could have just taken my money but he didnt and I really appreciated his honesty Theres a story about a different group who were totally skeevy He said instead that we were most likely to get great seats if we arrived earlier in the evening rather than later The two of us were picked up by free limo in exchange for having to buy two drinks each Thats fair especially as it was only 50 total for all four drinks We got there early and the women around us were still too sober We brought our own fun to counteract the grumpy grumpsters behind us That was around 830 pm I think But the men were already dancing and they were all just gorgeous gorgeous men Those fabulous dancers were immediately attentive and charming And soon the place was hopping We enjoyed a number of very attentive dances without having to share until the place got packed around 1230 AM When we left it was full of crazy women having an awesome and amazing time I guess the key is to make sure your bachelorette or birthday group isnt full of pissy women and come prepared with a good attitude nnAs to how Hunk Mansion compares to others my previous experience with strippers involved a couple of local shows at home Men of X MOX Thunder from Down Under TFDU and Olympic Gardens OG MOX and TFDU are just male revues in which you sit amongst way way way too many women and have no real interaction with the guys At TFDU for example a bride seated in the middle of our overpacked table kept walking into the aisles and trying so hard to have interactions with guys While very inexpensive those shows are so impersonal and lame as to be a waste of time And forget getting drinks at the overpacked bars of the male revues Hunk Mansion is SO much better than those places The men at HM were all over us and my friend got all of the attention she could possibly want It was easy enough to get drinks at the bar and the bartender was such a sweetheart and outrageous flirt Any woman would feel honored by the attention It was nice that not only did my friend whose birthday we were celebrating get some affection but so did I as her buddy nnAs to how it compares to OG Hunk Mansion is way better I swear that most of the men at OG the last time that I was there were on drugs were not very good dancers and only one guy had seemed to actually have any interest in being sensual with women Whereas at Hunk Mansion the men love women Holy moly Hector is insanely sensual That guy looooooves women Seriously get a dance or five from Hector Theyre also more athletic and better dancers I felt like OG was totally lame and I wondered why women got shafted excuse the pun at strip clubs Why do the men only get high quality and beautiful dancers Whereas at Hunk Mansion its what a woman would hope to experience at a strip club nnI also liked that the men at Hunk Mansion were upfront with prices and expectations so you knew exactly what youd get and it was a very fair transaction Much as in real relationships its always better when theres honesty involvedI have never been to a strip club before and I am so glad this was my first experience I am hooked The guys here are SO nice and SO FCKN HOTTTT Its been a week since I went and Im still daydreaming about that night it was AMAZING It is definitely entertaining and the guys put on a really good show If you are in vegas for some fun you definitely have to stop by at least one of your nights It is so worth it Trust me The guys will not disappoint Were already planning our next visit pI love this place I will be back everytime I come to Vegas My friend and I had so much fun The guys are super hot Not to sure about Ted but whatever floats your boat they have it  Hahaha The 30 cover charge is a great deal for a limo ride to and from your hotel and 2 drinks I wouldve spent more than that on just a cab I liked that it wasnt too crowded and we were able to find a table and this was a Saturday night  Waiting in line outside kind of sucked but it went quick My only regret is that I was so nervous this being my first time at a male strip club that I drank too much too quick and we had to leave earlier than my friend wouldve liked I cant wait to go back Ive told all my friends about it and well have a much bigger group next timeWorst male review EVER Stay clear ladies unless you like watching little boys walk around in their tennis shoes A complete joke and total let down only two dancers that even looked like gown men and the female manager was as rude as they come Not worth the cost or your timeThis was definitely the HIGHLIGHT of my bachelorette weekend I had been to a small male strip club many years ago in LA and I remember it being just ridiculous and thinking man this doesnt even turn me on unlike when guys go to strip clubs and totally get turned on by female strippers I thought this experience was going to be the same but I was wrong The strippers are pretty hot ahem pitbull and mojito and I actually got turned on by one of them during my lap dance because he was THAT good My gfs and I said we were just going to be there for an hour or so at max so we could go clubbing on the strip afterward but we ended up staying here longer because we all couldnt get enough of the men and craziness plus we all wanted lap dances I now know why guys can spend hours and a ton of money at strip clubs haha My gfs and I still reminisce about hunk mansion weeks later talking about how it was the best life decision we made that weekend If youre deciding between this and a thunder down under type of show I would go with this all the way This is way better way more interaction and overall guaranteed wild and fun time Thank you for the best weekend everMy friend and I went here for my birthday weekend a week ago today and boy let me tell you these men know what theyre doing  very sexywe will definitely returnits going to be our tradition every time were in Vegas which is quite a few times a year  thank you hunk mansion to the best birthday a girl can ask forsee you soonThey have great online deals for special events and occasions We got picked up and dropped off like queens with great service frm beginning to end Definitely will be booking more events at this place Come with extra cash ladies its worth every pennyTheres a little something for everyone here A guy of every type for every type of lady Came here for a bachelorette and they did treat our party like queens Lots to see and do Were having an absolute ball Yes its just as risquxc3xa9 as you think so dont bring your prudish friend cuz shell be upset Come with a GREAT attitude and you will have a GREAT timeThis place is AMAZING Great place for a bachlorett party  Arrow and Pittbull are great We had a BLASTLiterally just left Hunk Mansion at Larry Flynts Hustler Club Im celebrating my 52nd birthday and I wanted to party so we paid 45 for the VIP package which included two drinks and RT limo service Our previous experience had been to see the Men of Sapphire We immediately liked The Mansion better The limo driver was personable the hostess Karen was a sweetheart giving us two seats in the first row center stage The dancers were charming and very sexy even those who werent my particular type Im a sister I like thick thighs and a nice butt  It was Sunday not crowded but a fun crowd so we got a fair deal of personal attention Based on these things Id give the Mansion five stars The one star rating Im actually giving is because of the abysmal customer service we received from security and management I gave my niece 20 to buy a drink when she handed me the change I noticed that a third of the 5 bill she gave me was missing The drama began when she tried to exchangereturn it for one that wasnt mutilated We were first told that the 5 bill was real this was never in question We were then asked if we planned to buy something else as if that would impact our getting a 5 bill that was not practically torn in half Finally we were told that we would need to wait for security to review the tape to verify that the bartender gave us the bill and that this would not happen until the club closed Of course this was a ruse to try to frustrate us into saying forget it As Hakeem says in the Geico ads not today and I said no problem We didnt have to wait but after they reviewed the security tape we were told that when my niece accepted the change the responsibility was hers whatever the fcuk that means Really As Judge Judy would say thats a whole lot of who shot John ie nonsense over 5 Im in Vegas at least three times a year always for my birthday and usually with some girlfriends Im not a gambler so Im always looking for entertainment The Mansion went from a must to a bust in the span of about three hours The poor customer care was unbelievable Oh well cest la vieWe went to Hunk Mansion for our best friends bachelorette party on a Saturday night and Im so happy we did We had a wonderful time and the dancers servers front staff and London Steele were really sweet to us group of girls from Canada Our bride to be was smiling and laughing so hard her cheeks were aching after spending several hours at Hunk Mansion nAlso like the previous poster mentioned Kobe Colby he was making a movement of playing basketball so Im guessing Kobe spelling hehe was really entertaining and super cute I think he was EuropeanAsian mix so hot and our group thought he was the friendliest one He even hugged us all bye when we were about to jump into the elevator Props to him for making our group feel special Also theres a nice diversity to the men dancing so youll definitely find your favourite male dancer The men were all amazingly talented any man can bump hard and grind slow but actually having some dance skills is a bonus in my opinion nnLastly I would say for Canadian girls looking for a safe clean and exciting place to spend their bachelorette this is the place to be We spent 50  USD each and received a round trip limo ride from our hotel and 2 free drinks each The tables werent reserved but it was easy enough to get a bunch of tables beside the stage and there was 9 of usnnSide note the host London Steele is the man who inspired Dallas from Magic Mike the movie with Channing Tatum He was so nice to our group Ohhh and dont take photos or else the DJ will call you out and boot you out of the mansionNOT GAY FRIENDLYnnWe wanted to surprise one of my girlfriends for her b day as soon as we go there they notice us guys and would not approach my best friend maria When asked if my best friend can get a lap dance they responded saying they would give her a lap dance as long as my best friend or myself werent asking for onenndiscrimination at its finest I even had my Straight good friend defend us by saying that even if we did want a lap dance what would be so awful about itnn trust me if it were up to me I would be spending my money somewhere else but given the fact that I was trying to do something thoughtful for my girlfriend I was stuck on this one or just wait until we got back to Hollywood from our trip SMHGreat experience  The dancers are hot hot hot  They are also friendly and they dont seem thirsty like the men at other clubs They give a good show and they also work the crowd I will definitely be backI booked my sisters bachelorette here and it was amazing the bus picked us from the hotel to the venue and then drove us back strippers are very good looking and super nice and trust me they know how to dance I thought the personal lap dances were to expensive tho 25 for me is too much Drinks are a little over price as well but other than that the service was amazing and fun Lame is all I have to say Went on a friday night and Only 5 dancers The lap dances suck the men are more about showing you tricks and dance moves than grinding against you Dont waste your cash here at all There is a reason why after all these years this place doesnt have many reviews The only plus about this place is the guys are nice to talk too As for looks most are skinny not many are muscular and a few seemed possibly gayWent on a Sunday unlimited top shelf liquor And it was really top shelf Men are super handsome And great service  Will definitely return againCame to this place and I have no idea what everyone else is thinking with any review worth more than 1 star except they MUST be crazy  Please reconsider going here  Im serious  Im from Miami and we went to Vegas for a bachelorette  Ive been to Vegas plenty of times but never done a strip club  We went on a Thursday and arrived close to 10 pm  The place was pretty much dead  There might have been 6 other women there  The lights werent really dimmed and the DJ was just plain bad  Paying 30 regardless of how they want to market it by including free things is terrible  I wouldnt have paid 5 for this place  The guys come up to you and talk but they dont really do anything sexy to make you want to get a lap dance or pay for anything  Normally strip clubs have male dancers  This is what a strip club doesthey get guys that are hot to dance and then women want to give them their money  Its a simple rule to follow  We stayed for 20 minutes before we decided to make a run for the elevator  Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied  Dont make the same mistake we did by letting the other reviews influence you into going  They must have never seen a man before or know what a strip club is  TERRIBLEIve never been to a place like this and I didnt know what to expect Hunk Mansion felt like a speakeasy with a hidden room and entrance inside the much large Hustler Club We were given directions by one of the cashiers on how to find it go down the long dark hallway and make a right by the 6 Golden Boner and then make a left by beaver bucks then walk to the end of yet another hallway It was one of those times I asked myself did she say what I thought she said  At this point I had no idea what to expect but we were on a mission to have the best bachelorette party we can nnThe staff was friendly and the dancers were very professional We felt safe here as it was well lit and we could see everything that was going on  It was a Saturday night and the energy was high Our host was Thomas and he kept coming back to check on us to make sure we were having fun and we most certainly didThese guys are great they know how to make the women happy I recommend that you send your wife or girlfriend there to cut loose and have some fun Management here is really nice and service is great Ladys in Vegas are in for a treatAmazing time 19 girls for a bachelorette not a glitch organized All staff is greatThe dancers were extremely hot and the majority of them were so nice The problem we had was when we asked if my gay best friend could get a lap dance for his 21st birthday a lot of the dancers said they dont allow that there Some finally told us that the owner only allows them in secret rooms and its 150 for 15min instead of the normal 2025 That is complete discrimination and shameful on the owner We finally went to the girl section so he could at least get some kind of lap dance and girl on girl or lesbian action was allowed downstairs The discrimination there is just terrible and although we made friends with the strippers will never returnLadies skip the impersonal big name male revues and head to Hunk Mansion for your night out  They have someone for everyone whatever your flava man youll find it there Every guy starting with the host Thomas the DJ the bartender and all the dancers is there to make sure you have the time of your life and they deliver the fun in spades Youll get everything you want in a night out drinks dancing and attention  without the ridiculous hassle of your typical dance clubThis place is amazing  Great place for a  party  The dancers are great and fun to PLAY with  Defiantly recommend this place for a bride to beThis was the first male strip club Ive been to and I was pretty disappointed There were about 5 dancers and only one guy was good looking IMO see picture He was also the only good dancer so they definitely saved the best for last The first dancer from Cali was extremely awkward to watch he must be newnnI expected it to be much more fun and wild for a bachelorette party but it was pretty chill There werent very many people there for a Thursday night eitherFirst off our host Thomas was awesome   Kept in contact with me the day off confirmed our pick up time etc  When I called our driver for a ride home he said he may or may not be available in 30 minutes  Thomas got us a ride straight away   So thank you    n nWe came here with 11 girls for my sisters bachelorette party on a Saturday night  We booked the party package that included an onstage with the bride and entry  Its an additional 30 dollars per girl for 2 drink tickets  I think a pretty good bang for your buck lol   It is a must to get on that giant golden penis and have a photo  That thing is hilarious   nnFor some reason every host we had for different events didnt recommend this place  They all were recommending Men of Sapphire or Chippendales  Since I went to Men of Sapphire for my bachelorette party years ago I wanted something different for my sister   This is completely a different experience and a more one of one than Men of Sapphire  Men of Sapphire have more of a stage and you sit afar and watch more of a show Hunk Mansion the stage is super close and the men use the poles and engage more with the audience    If you want a crazier night then do Hunk Mansion   Plus I found the men a lot sexier at Hunk Mansion than Men of Sapphire   nnThe guys were all superhot expect the little annoying Guido guy he was our least favorite   However all the guys even little Guido had awesome pole skills and every guy was very engaging to all the females     If you do the package you can pick the guy you want on stage  So beware you will be bombarded when you first get there  So just like Larry H Parker they will all fight for you  I asked the bride to be whom she wanted   So I recommend the same to other bride to bes  Oh and seriously girls if you want your crotch displayed than where a dress  If not I recommend wearing jeans   nnThe pickup and drop off  nWe were picked up on time but the bus that took us was super old air continuing sucked and the speakers were blown in the back  The ride home was a lot nicer the party bus was awesome working air light show  I would definitely retire the one that picked us up especially in Vegas heat we were all sweating in that busnnThey have hookah at an additional price  I thought a pretty cool option   nnThe only dislike of the entire night is when I just got a beer and they let the ladies dance on the stage  Some chick hit my beer with her shoe and spilled it on the ground and everyone saw even the bartender  Luckily it didnt hit me or my friends  Its 15 bucks for a beer since I used a drink ticket  So logically since I didnt dump it and it was their fault they should replace it  Different story if I spilled the drink I would of just bought another and owned up to it  But it was obvious they knew the girl did it  The bartender gave me total attitude but did give me a replacement but he definitely didnt want to  He said oh any other place wouldnt do it I was quite pissed for a 50 cent beer I got such attitude  Not from Stixxxs but the other one   Stixxxs was super cool lite your cigarette for you made some pretty awesome shots Its the little things that girls remember and such a small gesture would of gone miles   But he decided to be a dick about it   nnOverall I gave 5 stars even with the rude bartender because the show was great and everyone had a great time  nnOh and seriously a must to stop by the Hustler store  They have some awesome stuff in thereTHE SECRET IS TO TEXTCALL YOUR DRIVER  If you purchase a package thats supposed to include round trip limo they DO NOT tell you how to get your free ride back and then the hostess will argue with you about whether you purchased the right package 12 of my party was forced to pay for a cab ride home and the other 12 that stayed longer had to keep arguing with the hostess  wait at least 30min after they finally agreed to let them take the limo home  Thomas was annoyed to handle my complaint but he did refund the prepaid money for the 12 of the group that paid the cab fare instead of getting the full benefit of the package we paid fornnOther than that I really enjoyed the time I spent there for my bachelorette party  The men are very good looking and encourage you to touch if youre into that kind of thing   Very entertaining show though I wish I remembered more of what happened after I went up on stage lol  Theyre pretty generous with their included drink couponsThe DJ plays great music Drinks are strong Dancers are sexy Our bride is having the time of her life with the lap dances Really enjoyed the champagne offered in our section Good times were had by allWas not overly impressed We have been talking about Hunk Mansion for a friends bachelorette party for months and decided to finally book the reviews sounded great and we were so excited about the mechanical penis We were all ready to throw down however much it would cost to get the bachelorette a ride on it We called to book our reservation and the guy on the phone was rude We specifically had questions about when to arrive in order to be able to sit all together and he told us he wouldnt be able to seat us together unless we reserved a table for more money The table reservation included two free drink tickets each so we went ahead with it Our driver was very nice and the ride was pleasant but we arrived at Hustler Everyone kept reassuring us this was actually Hunk Mansion though there was not a single sign that said anything confirming we were actually in the right location We were able to go in fairly quickly but in order to get to the male strip club they walked us through the female strip club which once again did not make us feel like we were in the right place since Hunk Mansion was so advertised as being geared towards women When we got up to the venue the view was nice both in scenery and eye candy but the place was empty except one other party Good thing we were pressured into buying the more expensive package to get a table together We were swarmed with good looking guys very nice but also VERY persistent in pressuring us to buy expensive dances and drinks I went with my friend to use our free drink tickets she ordered champagne and I ordered wine As she was talking to me I witnessed the bartender begin to pour her glass of champagne then when he thought we werent looking swap to another unlabeled bottle that was already open then when she turned around he finished it off with the original champagne bottle I told her what had happened and the bartender denied switching bottles even though I had watched him He ended up giving her the rest of the mini champagne bottle for free after we complained Later on we decided to buy shots the special was 5 Malibu shots and when they came out they were pink Since when is Malibu pink I might have overlooked all this if they actually had a mechanical penis as advertised but there was none to be found  This was not our first rodeo but definitely our last at Hunk MansionI would like to give a huge shout out to Thomas at Hunk Mansion  He rolled out the red carpet for me and my two sisters neither had ever been to a strip club before last night on short notice He had the limo pick us upthe driver was in constant contact so we knew when and where to meet Getting in the club was a smooth process and i LOVE the new venue The guys were hot there were plenty to pick from and a nice variety especially for a Thursday night  We had a great time and the guys were good with my sisters who were a bit uptight at firsthaha The other women all appeared to be having a great time as well whether they were there for a bachelorette party part of a couple or group of ladies I must saywell done Thomas and Men of Hunk MansionMannnn do I have lots to say about this place good and bad We came here for a bachelorette party on 11417 that we prebooked with a group of us girls had no idea where it was until I realized its part of the Hustler Club nnGood nThe place is pretty nice There is a bar a stage plenty of seats and tables as well as an outdoor area outdoor area was my fav Everything was fairly clean and nice as well as the restrooms Not as large as Sapphires stage and room but still well done nnThe amount they charged us to get in was fairly reasonable I believe 3045 which includes transportation and two well drinks Not exactly sure which deal we gotnnAlsoYou have some pretty awesome people working there nIxtsel the hostess at the front David our hostserver at the table Trent behind the bar and Marcus the DJ were all a great help They answered any and all questions I Had and were very friendly Trent and David helped us finally get some water after asking several times and Ixtsel even sent a follow up email to me that night When all of us were waiting on paid dances for the bride maid of honor and friends DJ Marcus was able to reassure me they had gotten it helped us stay on a schedule and let us know when to be ready nThank you to themnnBadn1 The bus taking us to the event was hard to contact and did not finally contact us until 20 minutes after I had talked to another man We were late and picked us up about 4045 minutes after the original pick up time Do you know how stressed that makes a Maid of Honor with everyone at the hotel room nn2 Once we got there and had gotten seated we had so many people who worked there telling us we had to move then that we didnt have to move then that we had to pay 200 then that we had to pay 400 on top of the entrance fee nPLEASE just give us a manager and let them tell us the exact amount nn3 Afterwards when we did get a manager we were told that it was the wrong table that they had to talk to and that we were able to stay nBut of course only AFTER one of us has paid 300 for a bottle because we thought we had to leave Way to hustlenn4 Obviously these guys work on tipslap dance money So yes some of them are fairly aggressive If youre not good at saying no dont go here Luckily Im pretty good at eyeing them to back off hahahahha nn5 The bride had to pee as soon as we got out of the place Most places dont let you back in which is fine Just dont blame it on her being too drunk Just say its because we need to pay again to enter We get itnn6 The entertainment was fairly slow At some points no one was on stage and you could barely figure out why you paid money and you were sitting there with no guys around Every now and then a show would take place with some guy and their lap dance person after the DJ would call for that person 5x to get them on stage No schedules Also very rarely was I impressed with some of the guys dancing At least they look good right nn7 Obviously the ATM is a NO GO other than your bank There are always fees when using ATMs No matter what But normally its around 375 high NOPE This one charged 12 DONT DO IT nn8 Dont bother checking in for that Free Shot Didnt even work when I went up and asked for that person AND you get a nasty look like you faked the check in offer I never want to feel that way when presenting a Yelp check in offer nnTo summarize Hunk mansion is within the Hustler club and you will get hustled Hold your ground call for management when needed for your ride because they wont call you to tell you their late ask when in doubt about pricing and ASK for a manager rather than taking word from 4 different hosts dont think youll get anything without nagging for it and be friendly with the staff Some of them can make your night and give the place more starsIn town for a bachelorette party and really wanted the bride to be entertained We paid 30 per person for a party bus to take use there and back as well as entrance fee and 2 drinks Lap dances were 25 cash and 70 for the stage one I think it was worth it very entertaining Diversity of the men was good multi racial all flavors I do think some guys were better than others I wish they were more oiled up Props to Colby Kobe He was so entertaining and ladies into halfies he was half korean and polish cute in the faceThis was the best thing Ive done in a long timethe guys are incredible You get treated like a queen the dudes are beautiful and they have moves like youve never seenmy girls took me last week for my bachelorette party i had so much fun the 50 shades of grey guy  was amazing he tied me up in chains and all thomas went out of his way to find us a ride back to the venetian because no driver wanted to take us back we had a drunkie with us he gave us a bucket in case and found a ride for us i would recommend this place to anyoneThe guy at the door was rude and tried to charge us for drinks even though the package said it was included then when wetted to leave there limo drivers were talking shit about our group while we were standing there when I said I can hear you and it was unacceptable he said fine you can take a cab then and walked away Unbelievable service here from the staff completely ruins the experience and wasnt cheapMy last review has Thomas making a comment that i must be a competitor  I would like to state clearly that neither my friend or myself even live in Nevada much less have anything to do with a strip club except visit when we come to town But his response to my critical review only solidified my overall opinion of how things are run at the male venue at Hunk Mansion  Instead of trying to rectify a situation or improve customer servicethey blame the customers accuse them of being fakeor dont even respond  Your competition doesnt need to put fake posts on Yelp you make yourself look bad with your poor service on the front and back end Celebrated by besties bachelorette party here I had requested a limo but was picked up in a party bus instead no music no fun When we got to the venue our seating arrangement wasnt the most comfortable one either But once I bickered with the manager we got a few comfortable seats and were able to enjoy ourselves Girls You have to try this place It was funI went with a group of 11 ladies for a bachelorette party Besides walking through our group on the way to the stage the guys gave us no attention at all I actually had to get up and walk around to find a guy standing around to give my friend a dance We all had money to spend and couldnt get a guy to come over to us nnAlso we were sitting near the guys dressing room and I could hear them complaining about having to go on stage for another dance It was only 10 oclock so Id hate to see them by 2 nnWhile OG isnt as nice of a venue the guys and the service is a thousand times better nnOverall bad experience Were actually planning a makeup bachelorette party for my friend at OGMy husband and I come to Vegas about once a month and for a while wed been considering finding a couples friendly club that had male and female revues  After contacting Tom very fast to respond to make sure it was couples friendly we booked our VIP pass with round trip Limo service and waited eagerly for the weekendnnWe were picked up with a gold Escalade which was clean and comfortable  Driver was very amicable and kept the conversation going return trip was prompt  The check in process at the front was quick and easy the girl at the male review was prompt and explained the rules and prices clearly  My husband can watch the basic lap dances but hed have to wait outside on the private dances  No big deal  We were seated about three rows back from the stage but its an intimate venue so all seats are good  nnAt first the guys didnt approach and I can understand they probably dont know how to gauge if a husband is going to flip out or notso I decided to put the money out on the table to give the hint that we were there to have a good time and later when I wanted dances I had my husband give the guys the money and ask for me so they could know hes cool with it  nnGuido was the first one to come say Hi  So I treated myself to a basic dance with tips  Dont underestimate Guido he has awesome control of his body and is very friendly  Romeo was also awesome  Was waiting for his stage performance from the get go and I bought a private from him  Very sexy  nnLoved watching the guys on stage the place was full of energy  Loved the up close and personal feel of the event  Guys are friendly and live for the opportunity to make you feel special for a Jackson or two or three  nnIf you are a big girl like me dont be intimidated the guys are there to show you a good time  They were very courteous to my husband they acknowledged his presence and shook his hand  I had a great time he had a great time  We cannot wait to come backnnSome tips for othersn1  This is not a commercial male review with cheesy dance routines where you sit 20 rows back and just stare  This is an intimate exposure with beautiful diversified men in real life  They are touchable conversational and available for special attention in the form of lap dances stage dances and privates  If you are not cool with that go see the missing thunder and rainbow team of chip and dalesnn2 Lap dances leave you feeling a little special and little exposed  Stage dances leave you feeling very special and very exposed  Private dances leave you feeling extremely special in an intimate setting  Pick your pleasure Very disappointing Booked my friends bachelorette party there and I would definitely not suggest it to anyone else I paid 30000 plus tax for the whole thinglimo service and one dance for the bride on stageoh and a cheap ass lighted tiara Says on the website there is a 2 drink minimum for each party guest and lists the price of drinks at 1250 and upso on top of the 300 for a bachelorette package each girl then had to shell out another 30 at the door for 2 very shitty drinks Venue was tiny with hardly any room near the stage so quite a few of us had drinks spilled on us by other guests and dancersand the mechanical riding cock wasnt even working which was just total shit The place is pretty shady and dirty looking and they had maybe one to two good male stippers I had to give it one star because it wouldnt let me give it a zero Never againDont waste your money ladies it isnt worth itwe should have just gone clubbingMy first thought when I walked in was Holy Crap ITS RAINING MEN Lots of hot guys with six pack abs and gorgeous faces The men are so kind playful and sexy If you want romance or seduction they will give it to you If you want to be picked up and thrown around youll get that My suggestions are to come with plenty of cash atm fee is 25 take their transportation and spend most of your money on the lap dances 20 rather than on the stage Buy dances for your friends and theyll buy dances for you until youre comfortable buying your ownWe took my BFF to the Hunk Mansion last week for her 50th Birthday We had the time of our life The dancers were extremely sexy and went above and beyond  to make sure we had the time of our lives My favorite was Tyson  I think Im in Love Make sure to make a reservation they willnPick you up and drop you off from your hotel You also get two free drinks if you make a reservation We are already planning on going back in MarchWere celebrating 2 bachelorettes and from the point of booking online to the end of the night was perfect There was continue communication between Thomas TJ our driver to London Everything was fun fun funI had previously written a review giving Hunk Mansion one star because of an incident that occurred when I was given change after purchasing a drink I am changing my rating from 1 star to 5 stars which is the rating I would have given before the incident with my change  because the management of Hunk Mansion was diligent in responding to my concerns Without making excuses they explained that they lease the space from Larry Flynts Hustler Club Regardless of who was responsible I appreciate good customer service and the follow up by both Tenya and Thomas was just that I really enjoyed the show and will definitely return on my next trip to Vegas Ill just make sure to carefully inspect my change before leaving the bar This was definitely way more fun than expected Went for my sisters bachelorette with 12 girls and we had a blast The men were beautiful and super fun not overly aggressive like we imagined Its worth paying to get your guest of honor on stageshell thank you for it later The cowboy was 1 on most of our lists but theres someone for every tasteMy first time at a male club and I didnt know what to expect when I walked in with our group It mustve been a dead night as there were a few other women around the tiny ramp they called the stage The lighting and the overall bare look of the place is what hit me the most We had to get our own watered down drinks as there was one waitress who didnt bother coming around I would highly recommend you know what youre signing up for one of their routines when you get a stage dance for 60 Ill know what to expect on my next visit Why come back The men They had the charm and persona to match their six packs and I love how they can read what you want and give you exactly that We ended up spending the night hanging out with a couple of sweet funny guys who made us feel so comfortable and not out of place at all Cheers Randy Aka Mojito  nPlease get an upgrade a good interior design and some mood lighting HMHunk Mansion is the ultimate night club for erotic entertainment with gorgeous hunks to fulfill your wildest fantasies We had the most amazing night and experiences to match  We plan to make other trips back to Hunk Mansion real soon Look out Vegas here we come This is my favorite strip club whenever Im in Vegas The men here are all very talented and sexy My favorite stripper is ecstasy he is so sexy And I love the way he dance The drinks are very good not water down at all Lets not forget about the DJ he was total bad ass playing all the hottest songs My friends and I will be back again In November 2017Went here for Bachorlete party We were picked up by a SUV The guy was about 20 minutes late but apologized when picking up saying something about traffic He was a fast driver  made us feel comfortable when being in his vehiclenI was nervous when walking in because of the intimidating bouncers that greet you at the door When you walk in there is a giant penis which is funny to take pics with There is a guys side and girls side Way more girl dancers then guys We went to the section with the male dancers The dancer who came to talk to me was Guido Torpedo I told him right away I was not very comfortable  a little freaked out for what may be in store for me Guido was very comforting  instead of acting how I thought a stripper would be he was sweet  listened to me babble for hoursI got a personal lap dance from him  before the dance he actually asked what I would like to see him in nI giggled like a school girl  told him I was not into gstrings or sparkly outfits I asked if her had just a pair of jeans He laughed  said he has his street clothes  usually doesnt wear them because they are restricting when dancing  but said he would do it for me When he came back I was still very nervous to get the dance so he gave me a few while I downed some drinks with the girls trying to get some liquid courage When he came back the dance was great I felt comfortable  he was not too pushy at all For the 36 minutes he was dancing I was lost in the moment Thanks to him for a great 1st time dancer experience He represents your company well The bartender that looks like Little Wayne was awesome He kept our drinks flowing  was very easy to talk to He was also smiling the whole night  taught me how to use a condom On a HOOKAH that is My only complaint about the mens side was a older blonde woman that must have been a manager of some sort She lingered at the end of the bar  I felt like she was watching us the whole time Very awkward feeling The DJ was also cool  let us girls over take his booth requesting any dumb song we wanted The place was empty so it felt like the whole place was to ourselvesnThe girls side was a lot bigger When we walked over there TRENCH was preforming We danced  singed along to all of his songs Even got to sit in VIP with COOLIOnYes he is still alive The drinks by the male strippers were decently priced but on the other side I paid 15 for a Corona OuchnThe dancer were all kind making small talk whenever we would run into them All around a cool place to have a little party at And again Guido Torpedo was the bestWent here for a friends bachelorette party We didnt know what to expect since it was our first time in a place like this but overall we had a lot of fun For only 25pp we were piked up in an SUV given tickets for 2 free drinks and had access to both the male and female strip areas The bartenders were great the place was packed and the shows were quite entertaining Definitely a must go place for a bridal party if you dont want to spend tons on going to the shows like Chippendales and Thunder From Down UnderOkay I got a package deal it said we will picked up by a limo but instead we got pick up by a suv with no air conditioner Then we arrive to the club went us stairs the men were okay but some were drity and creepy At the end of our night it said that our driver was suppose to take us back to our hotel but he didnt I called him 3 times no answer So I suggest u look other places maybe stripper King I would give this place no stars Very disappointed with this place and serviceOur bachelorette group had so much fun The staff was friendly and service was great But mainly the dancers were fantastic So much funHad a great time at the hunk mansion The guys are ripped friendly and put on a great show  what more could you want For 20 bucks extra we got a round trip limo ride which was a nice touch The mansion is definitely a must for bachelorettes or anyone who wants to unwind The host Thomas will personally see to it that you have a good time Unparalled customer service Will definitely be back here againIve been here twice the second time was much better than the first definitely coming back  However the reason why Im giving 4 stars is because there was lack of communication due to transportation and payment  The strippers are awesome though  Had a great timeRecently I learned that theres a shortage of male strip clubs and revues in Las Vegas Thats definitely news to someone me who doesnt think the concept is appealing With that being said I was actually the one who found this place  via Yelp heh  and suggested to my female cousins  who are male strip club aficionados   that they add Hunk Mansion to their itinerary In short I ended up going for the hell of it to see why they get so worked up over guys gyrating in sparkly thongsnnEntry fee to the club is 25 This price includes two free drink tickets and shuttle service from your hotel via Hustler bus Thats a pretty sweet deal considering how entry fees alone to some of the clubs on The Strip are around the same pricennHunk Mansion is located inside Larry Flynts Hustler Club thats just a short drive from the south end of The Strip Its a small intimate room thats next door to where the women perform Its equipped with a bar large stage and plenty of seating and tables nnThe free drinks we ordered were weak and diluted and the paid drinks were the opposite But hey cant complain much about free drinksnnWe had to wait for a couple of groups to arrive before the performances started Amateurs kickoff the night and its up to the ladies to decide if theyre Hunk Mansion material Once thats done the resident performers get on stage The whole time I was expecting bump and grind movements but I gotta give some of these performers props for climbing up 10 foot poles and doing some Cirque du Soleillike tricks If I cant do that then they deserve some of my singles to pay for their college tuition nnFrom what Ive been told the men at Hunk Mansion are more attractive than the performers at other male strip clubs and revues in Vegas There were a few dancers who were on the douchey side and all talk and no game However in general the guys at the club were polite and didnt pressure us into paying for dances Few even came around to ask if we were enjoying the show Staff members even came by to check on everyone and make sure that they were having a great time I cant recall all of their names but my cousins went crazy for Xavier Trey Pitbull Silk and Superman Give those guys moneynnI think Hunk Mansion is an ideal place for a bachelorette party or just to visit with friends who enjoy this particular type of entertainment Im still not a fan but the experience was better than I thought it was going to be It gets my seal of approval Have fun ladies And dont forget to do a Yelp checkin to receive a lightup tiara nnAnd this marks my 400th reviewBar service is great  Drinks never went empty  Dancers are hit and miss  If you are gay not the place  This is aimed towards women and bachelorette parties  Very warm so wear something light  Wouldnt come backThis place is a BLAST I went here for a bachelorette party with a group of girl friends and had an incredible time I honestly couldnt stop thinking about all the lovely men after I left PnnNot only did all of the dancers have AMAZING bodies they were all super cute too And very talented I was so impressed with how they all worked the poles  LOVED the ones hanging from the ceiling They were all ahem super creative with their sexy moves while hanging above the ladiesnnWe paid to have the bride put on stage We spoke to the dancer before she went up and explained shes a little shy and not to go too crazy He did an awesome job of respecting our request  she ended up with a very sensual and impressive dancennI also LOVED how all the dancers had different acts and costumes It made was so entertaining and fun We were all cracking up and giving screams of encouragement the whole night Ive done Thunder Down Under and was disappointed  it was basically a slightly more risque Back Street Boys dance routine Also only one or two brides in the audience actually get special attention EVERYONE who wants some attention at Hunk Mansion gets it Annnnnnd its fantastic DnnAlso the owner Thomas was fantastic He checked in on us throughout the whole night  making sure we were all happy and having a good time He confirmed our reservation via text before we got picked up and kept in communication with me to make sure everything went off without a hitch I wanted to really dazzle the girls with a limo to pick us up so Thomas made sure one was available to get us You can tell he really cares about his customersnnI HIGHLY recommended this for bachelorette parties birthdays or just if you want to have an extra special night with your girl friendsStarted at about a one starwe didnt get into vegas until after 830 which was the last pick up time so we found our own ride herelyft we spoke with people twice saying that was ok getting in was horrible and confusing Having fun inside with the cute guys had brought it back up to a four nNow were trying to use our included ride back and the person isnt responding and the door people are rude as fudgeto be updated laternJust downgraded to one because this is freaking ridiculousDoes Hunk Mansion exist or is it Hustler I chose hunk mansion to avoid the possibility of running into the boys at the bachelor party Luckily the boys were not there since we had to go through the women section to get to the male section The limo driver was very very rude and it was insanely hot in the limo The males at the venue were goodbut not enough variety The view and the actual venue was great thoughand the drink prices were well pricedI owe this place a solid review First time at a male strip club for my bachelorette party weekend We came here Friday night and did a Chippendales show Saturday night Although Chippendales was nice the men at Hunk Mansion are what we all look back on fondly This place is inside of Hustler Club Decently priced drinks nice management and beautiful men A night for the books Highly recommendJust want to say thank you to Thomas for setting up a great night for us Any time we have a special occasion for one of us girls in our group we call Thomas and he tells us the best package to get and sets up our limo transportation and makes sure he has a table reserved for us Hes always helpful and tells you like it is We always leave there having the best time ever I highly recommend this place for all you girls out there wanting to have a good time We cant wait to go backVery fun place I always have a good time when I go to hunk mansion Im surprised to read that someone on here wrote the cowboy is aggressive  He isnt aggressive at all Especially compared to male strippers at other places And he is definitely the hottest guy thereMy friends and I came to check this club out for the first time in July 2013 We paid 45 for the VIP admission which included reserved seats limo pick up and drop off and two drinks The dancers are very friendly and personable and the acts were varied and exciting The guys are very ripped and give you plenty of attention They dont mind if you take pictures either We were treated to shots of tequila so that was pretty cool too When I checked in on yelp they didnt have light up tiaras but they gave me a giant Hustlers cup filled with tons of awesome goodies Theres also a mechanical penis ride which makes for great laughs and photos Hunk Mansion is definitely worth checking out especially for bachelorette parties or anyone wanting some eye candy or more Shout out to the cute bartender and Superman Oh and Thomassuper awesome host that will personally see to it that youre having a good time Amazed by the customer service This was a lot of fun and I cant wait to come backIf I could give this place 10 stars I would First off it was my birthday weekend and where better to spend it than VEGAS My best friend told me she wanted to take me to a strip club my first experience at one and let me just say that I was NOT disappointed For start it was only 30 for a ride to the club admission  2 drinks When I got there I was a little intimidated since I have never been to a strip club before but all I can say is that from the manager nice lady to all the GORGEOUS SEXY BEAUTIFUL men EVERYONE made myself and my girlfriends feel so welcome and comfortable They were not aggressive or rude they were all very kind and sweet and GORGEOUS did I already say that My friend bought me a staged lap dance for 60 with my FAVORITE Maggio oh god that man is just too damn fine I felt a bit nervous being a plus size lady myself to get up on that stage but let me tell you they make you feel so comfortable It was so fun and raunchy  All in all I would highly recommend this place especially if youve never been to a strip club and are a little intimidated    still smilingA great night of fun I went a couple weeks ago with a bachelorette party and had a great time nMy favorite dancer was Guido the Torpedo He did amazing things on the bars  really made me sad that my friend and I were the only ones paying him attention and tipping him nMy favorite personality has to be Maverick hands down He was amusing and talkative and kept coming back for more Those two for sure earned the very last of my dollars nThe cowboy had hung around for a bit but as soon as one of the girls got a lap dance he didnt come back around I know others were thinking of a lap dance at that point so he missed outnThe other guys were great as well but we didnt spend as much time with them nWe had a great time overall and would definitely go back if only to see Guido and Maverick again Next time we will get there earlier Didnt know 10pm was late to arriveBooked hunk mansion after looking at thunder and chippendales Everything I read said to head to hunk mansion All the reviews are right on We had the most amazing time From the limo pick up to the second we left it was so fun All the gorgeous men were so nice and not creepy like some places We just had the best time and will be back I recommend this place 1000 times over  Thanks hunk mansion One of out top 10 girls nights outnThomas was funny and helpful and checked on us throughout the night nYes drinks are pricey but the entertainment is worth it nYes the dancers try to sell you dances its their job At no point was anyone pushy and every single one of us had a blastnWe cant wait to visit againAs a first timer I dont think I could have had a better experience My friend and I got this promotion on their website with the limo ride entrance and 2 drink passes Good deal overall The staff was super friendly and the dancers know how to have a good time The only unfortunate thing was just that the place was DEAD We went on a Thursday night and it was just us and around 2 other groups The company just need to work on promoting themselves and get more people to go because it was a lot of fun nnAdditionally I dont think people clean the limos well Since it was dark in the limo I just sat down and there was water on the seat I left the limo with sad water stain on my dress nnAlso ladies please bring enough money for the dancers I know we can be cheap asses but cmon how can u go to these places and not tip Overall you need to come and experience this I will definitely visit again Thank you hunk mansion for all the laughsmy oh my best male strip club in vegas service ride back and forth was awesome The guys were awesome cant wait to go back againHad my bachelorette party in February  honestly was a bit disappointed The place looks NOTHING like the pictures We showed up  the place was empty Weird to think since it was on a Saturday One of the dancers was being rude to one of my girlfriends  thought that was very unprofessional They only had about 4 dancers the whole night so we kept seeing the same show over  over again Overall we wont be going backI was totally underwhelmed There wasnt anything sensual about the way the guys were dancing It was just a series of tricks I could see any dancer do in the subway I couldnt get anyones attention for a drink Apparently the dancers wont give lap dances to guyswhat is this 1992 Homophobic much We left having blown 70 dollars for nothingHands down the most fun experience youll have in Vegas with a group of girls especially a bachelorette or birthday party Why should guys be the only ones to have all the fun at strip clubs The dancers here are not only handsome but sweet you can tell they are also having a blast The on stage dances are awesome and youll feel like youre watching Magic Mike Heres a tip its worth it to pay for the bachelorette or birthday girl to get an on stage dance The pictures will be amazingOur group of 9 went in for a bachelorette party and had booked one of the bachelorette packages  While we had a GREAT time and the men were hot sexy and super fun we had an unfortunate experience with a dance ticket and getting hustled  The dancers only make money from tips or private and onstage dances this is what the dance ticket is for and they are smooth talkers  Understandably so  Our party had a fun experience after a rough start which is why I gave three stars instead of four  Would recommend with a heads upWe had a great time at Hunk Mansion The guys are amazing and very handsome They did not disappoint at all and men were available all over the stage and floorWe were in Vegas for my daughters 21st Birthday I booked The 50 pp deal off their website which included pick up  drop and 2 drink tickets Our driver TJ was timely and fun on both pick up  drop off The dancers were great and good looking My daughter had a ball We even got her a lap dance Only negative was we werent told the drink tickets expire after a hour but a quick convo with the manager and he gave us new tickets We had the best time everNot to impressed  The dancers are very pushy and money hungry I understand they are there to make money but to stand around talking shit about the other dancers and saying how they are better was a huge turn off Felt like we were dealing with high school boys  We left within 2 hours of being there  I never thought I would say this but Chippendales was alot more funCame with the girls a few weeks ago as my friend was getting married  Club was very nice and the lady that seated us couldnt be more accommodating  Place was clean and the dj played a good mixnWe were all feeling pretty good and maybe the bride a little too good lol  I got her a lap dance with Romeo  He seemed like a nice guy  What was very disturbing to me was that the bride was a little drunk and I saw that Romeo was taking advantage of her  He had his hand all the way up her dress which was very upsetting and them I saw him grab her hand and but it on his privatewhich he pulled out  nThis was so inappropriate and I felt he totally took advantage of her nI think it is fine to have fun but when someone crosses the line that is going way to farnClub is nice if you stay away from himThe best night of my life Went here for my bachelorette party and had the best time Went with a group of 9 girls and we spent the entire night laughing by the end of the night some of us lost our voices This was the highlight of our trip and I highly recommend other bachelorettes coming here The guys dont pressure you if you are shy they will let you sit back and watch until you get into it and trust me you will get into it It was like magic mike i was in heaven My girls paid for me to go on stage and I couldnt stop laughing the entire time The rest of the trip me and my girls would say can we go back to hunk mansion yetCame in on Friday night for one of my besties bachelorette party and we all left with a huge smile on our faces It was all of our first male strip club experience and they showed us the time of our lives  My gf enjoyed her lap dances on stage and all the guys were good looking We got the 300 bachelorette party package deal and it included a party bus to pick us up and back lap dance on stage light up tiara champagne and 2 cocktails each person mandatory you pay at the entrance I will definitely come back on special gno events Thanks Hunk Mansion for showing us girls an awesome timeIve been pondering this review for some time I dont want it to in any way convince others not to go to Hunk Mansion as I think its just not my personal cup of tea especially considering all the other 5 stars   nnAfter doing some heavy yelp research I settled on Hunk Mansion for my best friends bachelorette party  Personally I had never been to a male strip club no there isnt real nudity here they stay in thongs but the reviews were great and riding the mechanical penis sounded like it was right up our alley   We saw on the website that 25 would get you a ride to and from 2 drink tickets and entry  We called around 11pm after our initial contact on the contact form was ignored and a limo driver showed up right on time at midnight as we had asked  The driver was awesome friendly and allowed us to take many a drunken photo in front of the limo  the limo itself was a bit old but nothing worth complaining about  Once dropped off he told us he would be our ride back to the hotel whenever we were readynnInside I checked in on yelp both cashiers looked confused when I mentioned the yelp check in offer the light up tiara and eventually decided who ever was in charge of that wasnt there that evening it was a Sunday  Strike one but whatever  Then we were told the price was 30 something a person  I told them the website had said 25  They then said the price was 28 a person and then dropped it lower to 25  Anyways I was a bit annoyed but still enjoying the fun  nnWe walked straight to the back bypassing the female dancer area and stopped at the area to get dollar bills  Service here was much slower than any other strip club Ive ever been to   Some of the girls stopped at the bar here too this was insanely slow and to top it off the mechanical penis was broken nnContinuing on we ended up in the male dancer section  It was empty perhaps due to it being so late on a Sunday night   It seemed weird to me that there wasnt a guy on stage at all times but this may be due to the fact that there were only about 4 guys  The guys came over and like the other reviewers mentioned they tried to take time to talk to us nice I guess but didnt interest me much  Plus I felt as though they were desperately begging for money  after about an hour we finally ditched the guys and had a much better time watching the female strippers do some incredible pole climbing tricksnnAll in all it was an ok night ended badly when we had to get a taxi back to our hotel though  apparently our driver was busy driving someone else for an hour  The party also spent some time in the Hustler store connected to the club which was funI have been to both female and male strip clubs in Vegas And Ive got to say that these guys are actually great and pretty talented Them moves are better than the girls whaat hahannCame here awhile back with couple of friends I loved that they picked us up with a limo However I didnt like the attitude of the limo driver He was grumpy and complained about picking up girls etc nnAnyways the place itself was well maintained and had a very friendly and helpful host as well as a bartender A cute bartender nnIf you are crazy and want to dive into it I suggest sitting in the front If you want to just watch I suggest sitting in the backnnOverall it was a great experience and definitely a place to try if you are out with your girls But keep your girlfriends away from emotionally attaching to the guys Ive seen it happen Dont do it nnOnly negative comment I have for this place is that the strippers seemed too desperate for money I am not exaggerating when I say that No means no If I dont want a dance from you But the guys kept trying too hard to sell themselves  and even said I am just trying to make money here you know This is my job Well what a turn off It wasnt like I was not going to buy any lap dances I ended up buying a lap dance for a friend from a different guy I think he was the superman He didnt pressure us into anything at all and made sure my friend was comfortable which was nice nnPlease dont pressure the customers too much Otherwise its a byefeliciaSold Me and my best friend decided we needed a little good clean fun  Having never been to a male strip club before  we hoped on yelp and started looking Hunk Mansion had great reviews compared to every other place we came across  We called the club for more info We were treated great right off the bat  So  we decided to give it a go nThe club sent a white stretch limo to our hotel for pick up Us two girls had the whole limo to ourselves where we pregamed and prepared for the night ahead The Limo was freewe tipped the driver well we payed a 25 cover that included two free drinks from their fully stocked bar nAll the employees were friendly the club was clean and nicely set up the male club is a small section of the over all huge Hustler club store nWhat a blast Most of the men were tall buff and ready to please with the exception of a few smaller boy like men  but Ehh everyones tastes are different The bartender was an absolute Hunk nThe men not only do a fantastic job dancing and working the stage  but they are very sensual and hands on with us ladies Love Logan nOverall A Fantastic night Were both hooked and will definetly be spending a lot of time here seeing as were frequent LA to LV weekenders nIt was obvious that all the women were loving it It was great fun encouraging and cheering on the other ladies in the joint We all bonded over the joys of naked men  theres even times where all the women are encouraged to hop on stage to dance and work the poles nOverall best experience I could have dreamed of Not a disappointing moment all night nIf you cant beat em  join emn We will forever be Regulars to the male strip club scene nThank you Hunk Mansion for an exceptional nightWhere do I even beginnnQuick note for those of you that dont want to read everything I am writing just know that EVERYTHING THEY ADVERTISE IS FALSEnnFirst off Hunk Mansion is really Hustlers Honestly this place was not what was advertised nnFrom the beginning the driver was 50 minutes late to pick us up from our hotel The website said first come first serve We did not want to be late and miss out on our table The driver said to us Dont worry theres only 5 drivers and we are all running behind If you where ready then you should have called me to get you sooner Wish this would have been communicated to me sooner Once the driver picked us up he was honestly an awesome man I would give Raul 5 stars alone He gave me his own card and told me to call him 30 minutes before I needed to be picked up and he was right on time for pick up Raul really made up for being late nnArriving We went in through a side elevatorREALLY SKETCHY The bouncer was really sketchy also The bouncer mentions the 1st and 2nd floor where girl strippers and the top floor was mennnRight when we sat down we where bombarded with men asking us for dances Honestly I know you need to make your money but give us a second to put our stuff down and get our drinks You would make better money if you make things about the Customers nnI previously paid for a bottle service online through the Hunk Mansion Website I had to ask for our bottle 4  times before I was told to go walk up to the manager up front Fine I did so We finally receive our bottle and glasses Cheap bottle AND ALL THE WINE GLASSES STILL HAD LIPSTICK ALLLLLL OVER THEM I did not drink my Champagne in fear that I would get something from the Fing glass This is not SANITARY We had to ask for new glassesnnNext Online advertised a 60 Cash Dance on stage of a Dancer You Want and Pay Him Direct This was not the case I had to walk up front to pay some guy and find out that the dance is no longer 60 My manager changed it last week to 75 I told them that I saw the add for 60 and asked if they could honor that The said No 75 or nothing Fine Gave them the 75 and said I know what guys my sister wants a dance from The add says she gets to pick the dancer They said No she doesnt get to pick We where also promised a Tiara for The bride but we never received that Everything they advertised was FALSE   I will attach pictures of what was advertised nnHonestly I did everything I could to just get my sister drunk so she wouldnt pay attention to the little things nnSide note The dancers here were really good but extremely aggressive nnI could go on and on about this place but I will leave it at that I hope everyone else has better experiencesWent with a couple of friends last week and had a blast For 30 we got a free limo ride to the club entry and 2 drinks For some reason most of the male strip clubs are only open on FridaySaturday but Hunk Mansion opens on Thursdays The guys are cool not creepy and gross at all and you will have a great time I will definitely be back next time Im in Vegas They also have a luggage room in case you wanna make a quick stop on your way to the airport lolCame here for my sisters bachelorette party and we had a pretty good time It was also our first time at a male stripclub so we really didnt know what to expectnnIf this is your first time going to a male stripclub heres a few things about this placenn1 No photography  for reasons Im unsure of they have a VERY strict no camera policy The DJ WILL call you out if they see your phone out My sister the bride  who just so happen to have her phone in her hands while one of the performers were dancing on her  got her phone taken away by the stripper himself AND  WAIT FOR IT  he dropped it down his crotch panties hahahahaha The funniest part and totally unrelated is my sis is also a germaphobe so that was a treat in itself just seeing her cringe haha But again this might not be something other ladies will find humorous but do respect the house rules  no photosvideosnn2 THEY HUSTLE  these gentlemen DO live up to their name Within 5 minutes of arriving we had quite a few men coming up to us offering lap dances for 25 Now I get it thats yo job you do this stuff but they definitely dont beat around the bush At some point I felt like carcass being circled by vultures And hey some people like to get straight to the lap dance I personally would have liked to get settled at our table first But they do put on a show They may come at you fast but they do very good jobnn3 Getting the bride on stage  60 something cash or 72ish something on card Needless to say I had already spent all my cash on the performers so had to put this on the card ahhhnn4 Maid of Honors  theyll target you too just watchnn5 They are definitely handsy  I came to this club thinking YOU the lady would be putting your hands on THEM But oh no they touch you too Not in a creepy molesting kind of way but they do incorporate you in their dances like a plaything Just something to think about if youre not comfortable with thatnn6 They are accommodating  our bridal party pitched in to put the bride and a bridesmaid on stage for a special dance I requested earlier that they go a little easier on my sister since shes a bit more conservative and  they were more than happy to oblige It was hilarious seeing the bride and her bridesmaid side by side getting lapdances of different caliber from the same mannnAll in all  we had a good time Cant share the stories to my friends enough At least next time Ill be better preparedGreat venue for bachelorette party Great variety of men so there was eye candy for everyone We had so much fun If your celebrating an event pay to get the lucky girl on stage It is TOTALLY worth it Our bride to be had a great time Thank you to all the hunks at Hunk MansionHunk Mansion was great Small intimate room clean and great guys The guys were hot as well as total sweethearts A couple of them were a little pushy trying to get you to buy lap dances etc But its their job and how they make their money so I understand  It was my daughters 21st birthday and they were all really attentive We paid the extra for her to get a special dance up on the stage and we werent disappointed Drinks were good bartender was great too We stayed for almost 5 hoursit was a blast Id highly recommend it to anyone wanting to let loose and have some fun Limo service was great too Not really any complaints In our group was a woman in her 60s 1 in her 50s 2 in their 40s and 1 21 yr old and we all had an amazing time If ever in Vegas again i will most certainly go to Hunk MansionHad a blast for bachelorette party will be coming back to see phoenix he was my favorite one  Im in love lol I really didnt want to go but I ended up loving the place Unfortunately after seeing these sexy men regular guys seem unattractive I highly recommendGood looking dancer  Exceptional car service to and from our location  Thomas makes sure to make everything just rightMy girls and I went here for my bachelorette party night My maid of honor called ahead and had a limo pick us up The limo driver and party bus were clean on time and a blast When we arrived Landon immediately greeted our group and gave us first class treatment Giving me my light up tiara and checking on us all night  We felt special right from the start  The guys knew how to keep the party going and knew their business Very impressed It was an unforgettable night with top notch service men and dancing I will also add that the women of hustler were top notch as well Thank you Landon and staff for the amazing service that is so rare in this day in age You and the staff care about customer service and it shows in everything you offer at your club nWe highly recommend this club  I would post pictures of how my time here went but then I would probably never be able to apply for jobs again Since anything goes in Vegas we decided to come here at the very early hour of 730 since we had a busy night ahead of us The call to make an appointment was easy and pleasant and the limo arrived exactly at 730 to whisk us away to man paradise nnEveryone there was SUPER nice and accomodating Because the majority of people in Vegas were probably still sleeping off their hangovers at 730 we were the first people there and got to sit front row Score Not only did we get two nice strong drinks and transportation for 25 but we also got a free shooters upon arrival I suggest that all of you use this as the place to pregame before going anywhere else because drink prices are probably the most reasonable in all of VegasIf you tip the driver well both ways he will definitely also drive you back to your hotel after the shownnAs for the men they were all super nice and conversational while we waited for them to get on stage I felt like we were almost at some networking event or something but with less clothing and more props The show was for lack of better words less of a show and more of a literally handson experience which all 7 of us thought was great Naturally my friends decided to surprise me with a stage show for my birthday but lets be real it was more of a gift of entertainment for themselves in which the cowboy and I apparently put on quite the show for the audience I dont think I closed my mouth once during the performance mind out of the gutter people it was obviously from surprise and laughterBest male strip club in Las Vegas  Came here for my best friends bachelorette party  Hot guys cheap drinks and round trip limo just to name a few things as to why I love this place  They have a 6 penis ride Make sure your bachelorette wears something that lets her give it a shot our bride had pencil skirt on and had to miss out Great customer service they really made us feel special and gave the bachelorette tons of attention   Thomas was amazing for dealing with all the changes I had to make to the reservation youre a SAINT  Definitely will make sure the next bachelorette party I go to in Vegas will be hereI had my first experience at Hunk Mansion just a few days ago for my cousins bachelorette party We had such a good time  we all had a good experience there The manager Karin was very nice  made sure we all were having a good time  were enjoying ourselves The guys were all really nice especially Maggio plus the two bartenders as well The facility was very clean  was a nice place nMy only complaint was that a few of the guys were a little pushing for their private dances But overall it is a great place to gonOne highlight of the night was seeing Andy Dick when we arrived having him take a picture with my cousin who was the bachelorettePerfect place to go for a bachelorette party Much more personalized experience than shows you can go to on the strip Management was very helpful when a person in our party thought she lost her purse we found itphew I will be recommending this place to any ladies I know who are going to Vegas and I cant wait to go back myselfCame here with my best friend to experience a male strip club for the first time All I can say is TAKE ME BACK We had an absolute BLAST The only thing I regret is losing the bartenders number snaps fingers Damn It was such an awesome crowd and the dancers were on point Looking forward to our next visitWe went to this place to celebrate my friends bachelorette part All of us are first timers we spent a wonderful and unforgettable night at this here   This is a must go place in Vegas for all girls All the male strippers are very cute and dance professionally loved their performance As first timers we dont have experience so I would suggest you to bring more CASH Then your night will even betterThis place is perfect for a girls night out or bachelorette party They guys are all smoking hot and really friendly and fun They want the girls in their club to have a good time This place was clean and well maintained  I would absolutely go backAbsolutely  LOVE this place  We are here now  Was a little leary after somereviews on here but DEFINITELY NOT DISAPPOINTED  Not too crowded but a good  crowd  The men are AWESOME  Some may not be  my style but  definitely  put on good show  Had an awesome time and very glad we chose Hunk Mansion over the other places  All the staff are amazing too  Will definitely  come back  next time in town  Highly recommend  Cant wait to come back Ive visited here 3 times in the last few months Each time my experience was better I drove to Vegas from Reno On my first trip down Thomas was great on the phone as we were running late He said pedal to the metal but be safe Our driver was wonderful Arriving at the club we were greeted by Karin who went out of her way to make us feel important DjJosh was great at making us blush I was approached by Guido and this guy has moves Not only on stage but his lap dance was youza He made the night  incredible and memorable for menSecond trip I follow hunk mansion on  twitter facebook and Instagram too I tried their offer of texting for a package and wow Was not expecting the great offer Our limo showed up promptly The second time around the staff was great at remembering me DjJosh was giving me shout outs and Guido had me in the biggest hug ever Enjoyed my lap dances once again with Guido and got my first lap dance with Maggio Great timenThird trip I used the same texting deal and Tenya was great Arrived yet again to have my two favorites there Guido and MaggionLadies if you prefer lots of attention I suggest you go on a Thursday night Its not packed as a Friday or Saturday The guys really give you 1 on 1 time nI want to thank Thomas Karin Tenya
